<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">Preface</span></h2>
<p>Of all the books written concerning the Indians of North
America, I don&rsquo;t know of one which treats of the Indians&rsquo;
great knowledge of medicine, the vast store which was theirs
of plants and herbs which possessed curative and healing
qualities, many of them far superior, even today, to the
medicine used by the white physician.</p>
<p>There is a reason. In some instances the white man did
not get the correct information from his Indian brother due
to the latter&rsquo;s inability to make himself understood&mdash;this
was, of course, also true of the former. Again, some information
given was intentionally wrong due to the ill-feeling
the Indian had for the white man. And again, many of
those healing plants were held in such veneration by the
Indians, that to impart their virtues to a white man was
an unpardonable crime, and the punishment meted out to
the offender was of the severest form.</p>
<p>I am an Indian, proud of it and of my forefathers, whose
bitterness toward the white man was only too well justified.
But time changes all things and bitterness and hatred never
made for understanding nor happiness.</p>
<p>In this spirit I wrote this book, in the spirit of doing
good. And in this I have the help and permission of my
dear uncle, Chief Pablo, of the Mahuna tribe of Indians
of Southern California, who permitted me to describe certain
plants whose curative properties have been kept a
secret by the Indians for over one hundred years. This is
the first time they are made known.</p>
<p>The Indian, living close to and with nature&mdash;the greatest
teacher of all for those who have eyes to see&mdash;became nature&rsquo;s
most intelligent pupil. Gifted with the keenest observation
<span class="pb" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
and the ability to reason, he searched the discovered
plants which nature herself had provided for any ailment,
sickness, or mishap which might befall him.</p>
<p>I am sending this book out into the world not for fame,
but as a messenger of goodwill and peace. May it be received
in this spirit and accomplish its mission.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_1">1</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">The Story of the Indians of the Pacific Southwest</span></h2>
<p>A gruesome, terrible year, the year of 1825! The fatal
year when thousands of Indians of the Pacific Southwest
were destroyed by that merciless, frightful scourge, smallpox.
And the tradition of its ravages is kept alive even today
among the descendants of the few who escaped death.</p>
<p>The tribal herb doctors at that time were wholly unprepared
to combat this disease which wrought such fearful
havoc. Sweeping along the entire Pacific Coast, it exacted
a heavy toll of human lives, so heavy, in fact, that the number
of Indians destroyed exceeded that of the American
lives lost on the battlefields during World War I.</p>
<p>The epidemic ravaged not only the Pacific Coast. It even
spread over the adjacent territories, carrying death everywhere
it struck.</p>
<p>Not until the end of that terrible year did some of the
Indian herb doctors begin to devote their attention to the
disease. And then, calling upon all there was in their knowledge
of medicinal plants, the chieftains, accompanied by
their medicine men, held a council at which the matter of
curing this destructive disease was brought under serious
discussion.</p>
<p>That memorable meeting took place in the world-famous
Palm Canyon, bordering the eastern slopes of San Jacinto
Peak&mdash;better known to us by its true native name of <i>Tahquitz</i>&mdash;situated
at the extreme eastern part of Riverside
County.</p>
<p>After the adjournment of the meeting the chiefs and medicine
men dispersed, returning to their respective tribes to
resume their regular duties, each one with instructions to
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
study ways and means which would effectively eradicate
the scourge so greatly feared by all Indians.</p>
<p>Now, among those who had attended the meeting was
Senior Chief Andres Lucero, of the Mahuna tribe, who was
looked upon by all Indians as the possessor of the greatest
knowledge of botanical medicine, and a master-teacher
among his fellow tribesmen who rightly considered him as
being without a peer in his field&mdash;thorough research and experimentation.
In his experimental work he was more successful
than any other, having had many years of experience.
In addition, he possessed valuable medical knowledge which
for centuries had been handed down from generation to
generation, each recipient becoming a true master in the
field of Indian medical science.</p>
<p>The men trained in the science of medicine were those
who had a natural aptitude and inclination for the care of
the sick&mdash;that is, men worthy of being selected to be taught
anatomy and the various ailments of the human body.</p>
<p>Evidence of this is to be seen in paintings and hieroglyphics
found in our Indian caves, which, in due time, it will
be my duty to use in photographic illustration in order to
correct many erroneous interpretations existing in collections
and writings.</p>
<p>To return to the beginning of our narrative, Andres
Chino Pablo, while deeply pondering one day on the problem
of what to give his stricken people, bethought himself
suddenly of how in previous years he had treated violent
fevers.</p>
<p>One was the fever which accompanied pneumonia and
which was, at times, fully as dangerous as any fever known
to mankind. But it was easily overcome through the administration
of compounded herb steam baths.</p>
<p>In the course of time &ldquo;Black Measles&rdquo; made, by mere accident,
its first appearance in the Pacific Southwest, again
causing widespread terror among the Indians. However,
Chief Andres Lucero had already decided what to do to
check the epidemic. Standing calm and cool one morning
and facing the rising sun, he called his people to him, everyone,
young and old. Like a shaft of granite he stood, straight
and erect, his eyes scanning carefully each member of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
tribe. At last, with tears in his eyes, showing how deeply
moved he was at the woe of his people, he announced his
decision. His words were few:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sons and daughters, as the Great Spirit arises in the
East, he comes to help us and he has given me the medicine
and the power to cure all those of you who are sick.
You will now go to the big cave where you will receive
proper care and treatment. All of you shall go, even those
who are not suffering from this devil&rsquo;s disease. And you
will all be treated alike so that your blood shall be purified
to guard you against the disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other words, to render them &ldquo;immune,&rdquo; in our language
of today.</p>
<p>Now, one of the many caves in the San Jacinto mountain
range, one which formerly had been used for religious
studies in Chino Canyon, was converted into a cave-hospital
and thousands of Indians were treated therein.</p>
<p>Due to the supposition, at the time, that the measles,
then an unknown malady among the Indians, was really another
form of smallpox&mdash;the diagnosis made didn&rsquo;t differ
materially from the latter&mdash;the conclusion arrived at was
to treat the disease accordingly.</p>
<p>A tireless and stubborn fight was waged by Chief Andres
Lucero. Day and night he labored indefatigably, not only
attending to his people, but also instructing other chieftains
what to do and what to use, thus letting them share
in his success in healing the sick.</p>
<p>Later on, the disease appeared in Twenty Nine Palms, in
Borrego Valley, Indio, Coachella, Yuma, Temecula, Mojave,
Tehachapi, Soboba&mdash;in fact, in all the small Indian settlements
throughout the desert and mountain. Chief Andres
Lucero was extremely satisfied with the results of his labors
which had laid the cornerstone of knowledge and preparedness
for the year of 1859, when a true epidemic of smallpox
made its appearance again.</p>
<p>Investigations revealed that the scourge had started
(<i>Temamaka</i>) to the north and had come (<i>Kichamba</i>) southward.
Again the eye beheld the sad scenes of dead human
bodies strewn along the valleys and mountains. The worst
suffering was among the Indian tribes dwelling to the northward,
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
who had shown a complete disregard of Chief Andres
Chino Pablo, and paid no attention whatever to his messages
and warnings.</p>
<p>However, the Chief stuck to his post until he saw his people
safe. Those who died were comparatively few. The dead
were those who, becoming panic-stricken through memories
brought to their minds of former happenings, had
fled into the desert. Had they but conquered their fears
and obeyed the Chief&rsquo;s orders, nothing would have happened
to them. Those were the victims of the plague&mdash;the
deserters from the tribes. The smallpox was kept well
under control in the settlements with only a two per cent
death rate, which means practically nothing when compared
with a previous death rate of fifty per cent caused by the same
kind of plague. In some localities it rose to almost ninety per
cent. Truly those were dark days indeed for the American
Indians.</p>
<p>I shall now give, roughly, the medicinal plants used then
and again in the same manner in the year 1918 when the
&ldquo;Black Plague,&rdquo; commonly known as &ldquo;Spanish Influenza&rdquo;
was raging throughout the American continent and Europe.
It was a strange coincidence, indeed, that a great many of
those who escaped death from the enemy&rsquo;s bullets on the
battlefield perished from the &ldquo;Black Plague.&rdquo; The Indians,
however, again won their battle against this frightful disease
by the same means which had been employed against measles
and smallpox with no loss of life whatsoever.</p>
<p>What a worthy and successful experiment it had proved
to be under the wise guidance of Chief Andres Lucero,
of the Mahuna Indians of Guana-pia-pa! He was truly a
noble character whose labors, love for his people, and self-sacrifice
saved the lives of thousands of Indians, and without
whose loyalty and kindness to other tribesmen, the American
Indian in the Pacific Southwest would be an extinct
race of people today, with no one to tell what had actually
taken place in the wild mountain regions and the desolate
desert, which were neither inhabited nor trespassed upon
by the white race.</p>
<p>The Indians compounded steam-bath herbs for the cure
of &ldquo;Black Measles&rdquo; and smallpox from the following:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<table class="center" summary="">

<tr><td class="l"><i>Sambucus pubens</i> </td><td class="l">Haa-saat</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Please bear in mind that the Indian name Tut-tut bestowed
upon the plant <i>Ephedra</i> means something that pertains to
the very sacred in Indian medicinal art. This sacred Indian
name befitted the plant for the great medical value it possessed
and for the important part it played in stamping
out the horrible smallpox plague of 1857.</p>
<p>Thus came about the saving of Indian lives.</p>
<p>Help us save and preserve the wild plants for the benefit
of mankind.</p>

<h3>Stomach disorders, worms, dysentery, diarrhea, etc.</h3>
<h4>SISYRINCHIUM ANGUSTIFOLIUM
<br />(<i>Ind. Man-ta-ca</i>)</h4>
<p>Commonly known as Blue Star Flower Grass. Found
widely distributed along the rich southern slopes of the
lower coastal ranges. Effective in the treatment of functional
affections of the stomach. In the form of tea, the entire plant
was used to eradicate all kinds of stomach worms. Flowering
season from March to April.</p>
<h4>DIPSACUS GLUTINOSUS
<br />(<i>Ind. Vaah-se-le-coo</i>)</h4>
<p>Known also as Monkey Flower, a plant not indigenous to
any particular soil, grows abundantly in California in the
lower coastal ranges, and also in the upper regions. Leaves,
flowers, and stems were taken in the form of tea, and effected
a thorough cure in severe cases of diarrhea.</p>
<h4>VITIS VULPINA CALIFORNICA
<br />(<i>Ind. Esq-urana-quat</i>)</h4>
<p>Also called Wild Grape. It occurs mostly along rich river
bottoms and marshy soils generally. Usually associated with
Wild Berry Vines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h4>RUBUS VILLOSUS
<br />(<i>Ind. Pick-lam</i>)</h4>
<p>The Wild Blackberry. The roots of either of the two
genera, boiled into a tea and given the patient, will afford
permanent relief in mild cases of diarrhea. The roots may
be gathered and used at any time of the year.</p>
<h4>CAPSELLA BURSA-PASTORIS
<br />(<i>Ind. Pa-sil</i>)</h4>
<p>Also called Shepherd&rsquo;s Purse. Probably one of the most
common of all plants in Southern California soils, growing
throughout the year on irrigated lands and on arid soils.
Boiled into a tea it is a certain cure for even severe cases of
dysentery. No more than two to three cups should be taken.
This little plant is a blessing to mankind and should be
made use of. It is the medicinal queen, and surpasses all
others in cases of dysentery and diarrhea.</p>
<h4>HEDEOMA PULEGIOIDES
<br />(<i>Ind. Mo-cash</i>)</h4>
<p>American Pennyroyal. Considered as the greatest nuisance
by farmers. As a curative agent in severe cases of dysentery
it ranks next to <i>Capsella bursa-pastoris</i>. It is general
throughout California, and blooms from August to September.</p>
<h4>ANTHEMIS NOBILIS
<br />(<i>Ind. Sa-mat-pl-ol</i>)</h4>
<p>American Field Camomile. A very common plant growing
everywhere in California. It was used extensively for
babies suffering from colic, and also to regulate unsettled
stomachs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<h3>Painful congestion of the stomach.</h3>
<h4>MALVA ROTUNDIFOLIA
<br />(<i>Ind. Mal-val</i>)</h4>
<p>American Common Mallow, compounded with blossoms
of California Wild Rose, or the seed.</p>
<h4>ROSA CALIFORNICA
<br />(<i>Ind. O-chul</i>)</h4>
<p>American California Wild Rose. This beautiful wild rose-bush
inhabits the coastal ranges, and may be found far
inland along open spaces in heavy woodland abounding in
rather rich and mulchy soil.</p>
<p>Used in cases of stomach fevers, the ripe seed is given in
the form of tea to relieve the stomach clogged with food as
well as in so-called cases of painful congestion.</p>
<h4>MONARDELLA VILLOSA
<br />(<i>Ind. Tah-lis-wet</i>)</h4>
<p>Skirting for its habitat the high mountain lands, it is very
seldom found anywhere else. It is a native of California, and
is used chiefly for the relief of ordinary stomach-ache. When
in bloom it is very fragrant and blossoms from late May till
June. (American Horsemint&mdash;sometimes called Pennyroyal)</p>
<h3>Fevers and constipation of the stomach.</h3>
<h4>ERYTHAEA MUEHLENBERGII
<br />(<i>Ind. Co-oniche-la-wa</i>)</h4>
<p>Its habitat is confined to a few localities in San Diego
County, the coastal regions in Santa Barbara, Orange County,
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
and in San Bernardino along the southern border of the Mojave
Desert.</p>
<p>It was used in the form of an infusion in cases of constipation
caused by fever of the stomach.</p>
<h3>Fevers.</h3>
<h4>JUNIPERUS CALIFORNICA
<br />(<i>Ind. Gla-wat-pool</i>)</h4>
<p>American Juniper Berry. Its habitat extends from our
high mountain ranges in northern San Diego County to
Monterey County. The berries have a short season, ripening
in these regions from late in July until early in September.
They were used for making tea or simply chewed in
cases of La Grippe fevers. They may be gathered, dried,
and stored for future use.</p>
<h3>Lung fevers.</h3>
<h4>PAEONIA BROWNII
<br />(<i>Ind. Quel-ta-bat</i>)</h4>
<p>American Wild Peony. It inhabits shady canyons growing
only on deep, rich, decomposed mulch. The blossoms are
of deep red color, and the blooming season lasts from May
until June. Its roots bear a strong resemblance to young
sweet potatoes and were gathered to be used in the form of
tea for complicated lung fevers. The tea has a decidedly bitter
taste.</p>
<h3>Stomach fevers.</h3>
<h4>VERBENA HASTATA
<br />(<i>Ind. Muy-u-vees</i>)</h4>
<p>American Wild Vervain. Inhabits the lower coastal ranges
and pasture lands. Its blooming period is from late in May
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
until July. This plant is remarkable for bearing three different
colored blossoms&mdash;in some localities white, in others,
pink, and then again, blue&mdash;all this owing to the mineral soil
formation. The root is used for complicated stomach fevers.</p>
<h3>Fevers.</h3>
<h4>MORAJAUM
<br />(<i>Ind. Saa-al</i>)</h4>
<p>Grows along rivers and lake borders. This plant, being of
a semiaquatic nature, resembles some of our wild orchids
and blooms but a short season. The entire plant is used in
cases of fevers complicated with headaches.</p>
<h3>Eruptive Fevers.</h3>
<h4>SAMBUCUS PUBENS
<br />(<i>Ind. Haa-sat</i>)</h4>
<p>American Elderberry. Indigenous to the coastal regions.
The yellow blossoms were extensively used by all Indian
tribes only in cases of measles.</p>
<h4>MIRABILIS CALIFORNICA
<br />(<i>Ind. See-wish-pe-yack</i>)</h4>
<p>American Four O&rsquo;clock. The root of this plant served the
same purpose as American Elderberry. Its habitat is Santa
Barbara County, Calif., and it is not found anywhere else
in a wild state.</p>
<p>There are no records that it was used for other eruptive
fevers such as smallpox, scarlet fever, etc. These were introduced
into this country later on by white European adventurers
and settlers, the first cases being recorded in 1825.
These diseases were greatly dreaded by the Indians, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
whenever any of them contracted this malady, they would
invariably vacate the locality they were in, and move many
miles away to virgin country.</p>
<p>And, as a warning of danger to fellow tribesmen and to
keep them away from the abandoned camp, all the rock
mortars and clay pots were turned upside down and partly
buried in the ground.</p>
<h3>Plant poisoning.</h3>
<h4>GRINDELIA CUNEIFOLIA
<br />(<i>Ind. Mie-chowl</i>)</h4>
<p>Grows in alkaline soils and its blooming season is from
August to September. The plant was used a great deal in
cases of itching skin eruption caused by poison oak, and is
a cure for such disorders. (American Gum Plant)</p>
<h4>RHUS DIVERSILOBA
<br />(<i>Ind. E-yal</i>)</h4>
<p>Botanical Serum. This is the poison oak itself, of which
the roots, during the dormant period, are cut and properly
dried. When taken in the form of tea in a quantity of not
more than four ounces, it will render a person immune
against any further poisoning. This is a bona fide Indian
formula.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
Blooming season from May to June.</p>
<div class="fnblock"><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_1" href="#fr_1">[1]</a>I ask my readers not to try this serum pending further laboratory experiments.
I plan to subject myself to exhaustive tests under scientific observation
and to publish the results.
</div>
</div>
<h3>Ulcers and diseases of the skin and feet.</h3>
<h4>ANTENNARIA MARGARITACEA
<br />(<i>Ind. Te-bish-samat</i>)</h4>
<p>American Cotton Weed. Its habitat is all along the Southern
California hill slopes, and the beautiful pearly flowers
are used for ulcers and sores of the feet which fail to respond
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
to treatment by other medicaments. The blossoms must be
boiled. The liquid obtained is used to bathe the feet, and
all parts of the skin affected. A very effective cure. The blossoms
are also ground into a powder and applied to the part
affected.</p>
<h3>Burns.</h3>
<h4>SOLIDAGO NEMORALIS
<br />(<i>Ind. Pa-co-se-cheeh</i>)</h4>
<p>American Western Goldenrod. Its habitat is the river and
creek bottom lands. Quite common in California, this plant
has great healing power, especially in cases of old raw burns
that have failed to heal properly, as well as major rotten
ulcers. The leaves of the plant may be boiled and the liquid
used to bathe the affected parts; while the pulp, as a poultice,
is to be placed upon the burns and ulcers to promote
disinfection and to hasten a rapid growth of new healthy
flesh.</p>
<p><i>Solidago nemoralis</i> has one other great virtue of considerable
value. Two to three baths in a strong solution, prepared
by boiling, will cure the Seven-Year Itch and free the
victim from that terrible malady.</p>
<h3>Fistulas and running sores.</h3>
<h4>PENTSTEMON CORDIFOLIUS
<br />(<i>Ind. Ting-gi-wit</i>)</h4>
<p>American Wild Fuchsia. A native of the coastal ranges,
northward from San Diego County to Monterey, Calif., this
dark-green shrub is very attractive to the eye. It bears an
array of deep-red blossoms, well-formed in clusters, at the
very tip of long slender branches. It was used as a poultice
and a wash for fistulas and deep, pus-running ulcers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h3>Eruptive scalp diseases.</h3>
<h4>EUPHORBIA
<br />(<i>Ind. Te-mal-hepe</i>)</h4>
<p>A native of California, it is quite common on our inland
fields. It is used for minor skin eruptions and scalp diseases.
Used as a wash only. It blooms from early May to July.</p>
<h4>AMBROSIA ARTEMISIFOLIA
<br />(<i>Ind. Watch-ish</i>)</h4>
<p>American Common Ragweed. Grows in abundance in
swamps and along waterways. There are two distinct species
of this worthy plant, the dwarf variety and the gigantic kind.
Either may be used for the same purpose as mentioned for
<i>Euphorbia</i>. In full bloom from July to September.</p>
<h3>How to retain the natural color of the hair.</h3>
<h4>ARTEMISIA TRIDENTATA
<br />(<i>Ind. Ulu-ca-hul-vaal</i>)</h4>
<p>American Common Sage. Habitat, the California desert.
For a good many years this plant has been used to restore the
color of hair, but the method used and practiced is far from
that of our people, the Indians. And this can be traced back
to the misunderstanding of the people who first introduced
this use of sage for that purpose. Of course, washing the hair
with it as a scalp treatment will do no harm, because the
plant itself has soothing and healing qualities; but to maintain
the natural color of the hair, or to restore gray hair
to its former color, one must drink the infusion when compounded
in the way we know. The plant blooms from April
to June.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h3>Women&rsquo;s diseases.</h3>
<h4>ARTEMISIA CALIFORNICA
<br />(<i>Ind. Hul-vaal</i>)</h4>
<p>Habitat, the coastal regions. The infusion made from this
plant was used a great deal in cases of vaginal trouble. Blooming
period from March to May. (American Wormwood)</p>
<h4>RAMONA POLYSTACHYA
<br />(<i>Ind. Qua-seel</i>)</h4>
<p>American White Salvia, playing a very important part in
healing internally and removing particles of the afterbirth.
The infusion from the roots was given to the patient to
drink regularly in place of water.</p>
<h4>LARREA MEXICANA
<br />(<i>Ind. Ato-col</i>)</h4>
<p>American Creosote Bush. Its habitat covers the entire
length and breadth of the Mojave Desert, San Bernardino
County, and Riverside. This plant was used in cases of
cramps of the stomach due to delayed menstruation, and in
cases of this nature not more than one half of a cup of the
tea was drunk. This plant is in full foliage from May to
October.</p>
<h4>CHENOPODIUM AMBROSIOIDES
<br />(<i>Ind. Epa-so-tee</i>)</h4>
<p>Its habitat is in swamp bottom lands. The root of the
plant was used in cases where the menstrual period had
been overdue for five or as many as ten days. The plant itself
has a rather offensive odor, but the boiled root is quite
agreeable to the taste and very effective. The patient may
drink as much of the tea as desired. Blooming season from
March to late fall. (American Goosefoot)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h4>CRACCA VIRGINIANA
<br />(<i>Ind. Po-hiel</i>)</h4>
<p>American Garden Rue. A common garden shrub introduced
into this country at the beginning of the early mission
days.</p>
<p>Although the odor of this plant is quite disagreeable to the
sense of smell, the infusion is very rich in flavor and not
bad at all.</p>
<h3>Flesh-wounds, knife-cuts, etc.</h3>
<h4>ANEMOPSIS CALIFORNICA
<br />(<i>Ind. Che-vnes</i>)</h4>
<p>American Swamp Root. Habitat, swamps. This plant is
plentiful in California&mdash;the territory where it grows wild
could be measured in thousands of acres. When cut, dried,
and powdered, it can be used for the disinfection of knife-cut
wounds, and to draw and promote the growth of healthy
flesh. (Spanish <i>Yerba Mansa</i>)</p>
<h4>GRINDELIA SQUARROSA
<br />(<i>Ind. Tanga-wet</i>)</h4>
<p>Habitat, low, sandy loam soils. For above-mentioned purposes
this plant is very valuable from a medicinal standpoint,
as it makes all wounds respond quickly to healing, when
used as a wash and for disinfection of cuts. A wet pulpy poultice
must be applied to the wounds for quick results. The
plant blooms from June to August. (American Gum Plant)</p>
<h4>FRASERA
<br />(<i>Ind. So-cat-llami</i>)</h4>
<p>American Deer Ears. Habitat, the high sierras and coastal
ranges. The infusion is used for the treatment of infected
sores.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h4>CARDUACEA
<br />(<i>Ind. San-ca</i>)</h4>
<p>American Green Sage. Its habitat is the Mojave Desert,
San Bernardino County and north of the southern borders
of the San Joaquin Valley. This plant is very valuable, being
very powerful and of great medicinal use, and much attention
should be given it by men of science.</p>
<p>The Indians used it universally in cases of serious and
major wounds&mdash;the infusion being given the patient if symptoms
of blood poisoning were present. Tetanus, commonly
known as lockjaw, was easily overcome, thus eliminating the
surgical operations so frequently resorted to by the medical
profession. The infusion was also administered in cases of
childbirth as a preventative of blood poisoning and gangrene
with <i>Ramona polystachya</i>.</p>
<h4>OPUNTIA
<br />(<i>Ind. Tu-nah</i>)</h4>
<p>American Cactus Pear. Its habitat, the desert and dry lands.
This plant was fully as important as <i>Piperacea</i>. The large
leaves were scraped of their thorns and a plug made out of
the leaf, according to the nature of the wound, and inserted
into it, healing it quite rapidly&mdash;a first-class piece of botanical
surgery.</p>
<h3>Healing.</h3>
<h4>PLANTAGO MAJOR
<br />(<i>Ind. Pal-qua-ah</i>)</h4>
<p>American Plantain. Its habitat is swamps and localities
where there is abundant moisture. The plant, like many
others, was used to dislodge and draw deeply embedded poisonous
thorns and splinters from the flesh. The operation
was quite simple. It consisted of applying a light coating of
suet on one of the leaves, this was covered with another leaf
and then placed, tied down firmly, over the thorn or splinter
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
to be removed. It usually requires about 10 hours for the
thorn to appear at the surface of the skin. The same procedure
can also be used by persons who have accidentally
stepped on a rusty nail&mdash;thus avoiding danger of blood
poisoning. The simple poultice described above will prevent
that.</p>
<h4>CLEMATIS LIGUSTICIFOLIA
<br />(<i>Ind. Chee-va-tow</i>)</h4>
<p>The California Clematis is a sister plant of the Eastern
Clematis, a very good healer in the treatment of skin eruptions,
the infusion to be used as a wash.</p>
<p>Inhabits the mid-coast and inland ranges, and, to the east,
the territory where Daniel Boone&rsquo;s activities played their
part and took their place in American history. Nothing,
however, is mentioned about this plant at the time the Indians
were pursuing him in the wilds of Kentucky, and yet
it was one of the strong vines of <i>Clematis</i> which enabled
Daniel Boone to escape and save his life by cutting it with
his hunting knife above ground and hurling himself far out,
thus putting the Indians off his track.</p>
<p>Myself an Indian, I have always admired Daniel Boone
for his cool presence of mind. He was brave and fearless,
although not a showman like Buffalo Bill and others whose
exploits were chiefly founded on personal motives.</p>
<h3>Coughs, colds and sore throat.</h3>
<h4>RUMEX HYMENOCALLIS
<br />(<i>Ind. Ca-na-ma</i>)</h4>
<p>American Wild Rhubarb. Thrives in dead, sandy soils,
and is very common throughout Southern California. The
roots are long and bear a close resemblance to sweet potatoes.
The infusion made from it has an acrid taste, and,
when used as a gargle several times in cases of cough and
sore throat, it will be found to give complete relief. The
plant blooms in June and July.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h4>PRUNUS SEROTINA
<br />(<i>Ind. Is-lay</i>)</h4>
<p>American California Wild Cherry. At home in the high
mountain ranges. An infusion of the bark in spring or summer
while the sap is running, or of the roots in winter when
the tree is dormant, may be used for common coughs.</p>
<h4>PRUNUS ILICIFOLIA
<br />(<i>Ind. Is-lay</i>)</h4>
<p>Holly-Leaf Cherry. Used for the same purposes as <i>Prunus
serotina</i>.</p>
<h4>SPIRAEA SALICIFOLIA
<br />(<i>Ind. Ha-ba-ba-neek</i>)</h4>
<p>American Queen of the Meadows. Its habitat is the low
coastal ranges. The root of the plant was used for common
coughs and chest colds.</p>
<h4>EUPATORIUM PURPUREUM
<br />(<i>Ind. Sa-ca-pe-yote</i>)</h4>
<p>American Joe-Pye Weed. It was used for the same purpose
as <i>Spiraea salicifolia</i> in localities where that plant
couldn&rsquo;t be obtained, although the latter was greatly preferred
for the extra medicinal qualities it possessed as a mild
laxative. The root, when made into an infusion, is extremely
pungent and rich in flavor, but agreeable in taste to most
people.</p>
<h4>MARRUBIUM VULGARE
<br />(<i>Ind. O-o-hul</i>)</h4>
<p>American Horehound. Its habitat is the woodland. Although
the infusion made from the leaves and flowers is
rather bitter, it is very good for ordinary coughs and sore
throats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h3>Old dry coughs.</h3>
<h4>AUDIBERTIAS STACHYOIDES
<br />(<i>Ind. Seel</i>)</h4>
<p>American Black Sage. This plant is one of the most valuable
of all for the cure of deep dry coughs of long standing,
which have settled in the bronchial tubes. This does
not mean coughs of two or three weeks&rsquo; duration, but those
which have existed for a period of from four to six months
and which have, therefore, reached a chronic, dangerous
stage.</p>
<p>The infusion was made full strength and given to the patient
in small doses, hot&mdash;never cold&mdash;in the daytime, and
one extra big dose before retiring.</p>
<h3>Blood hemorrhages of the lungs.</h3>
<h4>DENNSTAEDTIA PUNCTILOBULA
<br />(<i>Ind. Ma-ciel</i>)</h4>
<p>American Hay-Scented Wild Fern. Its habitat lies in the
high California mountain ranges. We are now coming to
the tuberculosis line. Hemorrhages of the lungs, and common
diseases which prevail to a great extent among people
who, through neglect and irregular habits, intensify coughs
and colds.</p>
<p>It was nothing to an Indian to overcome these maladies
of the lungs, which in his case were usually due to accidental
injury. This wild fern bears oil nodules on the crown of the
root system and they are available only at a certain period,
from May to June.</p>
<h3>Coughs and asthma.</h3>
<h4>ERIODICTYON GLUTINOSUM CALIFORNICUM
<br />(<i>Ind. Tan-que-bel</i>)</h4>
<p>Commonly known as <i>Yerba Santa</i>, this plant proved to be
possessed of great medicinal merits, and was very soon
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
adopted by the mission friars for its outstanding qualities
in the cure of coughs, asthma, rheumatism and pneumonia,
being rightly considered as far superior in this respect to
any of the other medicines brought by them from Europe.
In fact, so great was the medicinal usefulness of these plants
and hundreds of others known to the Indians, that they
soon became the objects of study and investigation, which,
however, met with failure, due to the severe punishment
meted out to any and all Indians for divulging any secrets
pertaining to the medical history of plants used by the tribes.
A penalty which was sufficient to deter them from any further
misdeeds in that direction, and which they always remembered.
Quite a contrast to the modern, elastic laws of our
present civilization.</p>
<h4>ERIODICTYON CALIFORNICUM
<br />(<i>Ind. Que-bel</i>)</h4>
<p>American White Woolly Holly Plant is the sister plant of
<i>E. glutinosum</i>.</p>
<h3>Cathartics.</h3>
<h4>ERIOGONUM ELATUM
<br />(<i>Ind. Pa-va-coneel</i>)</h4>
<p>American Bottle-Weed. Its habitat lies in the volcanic regions
of the Mojave Desert. This plant is rather peculiar in
its growth, thriving on poisonous volcanic soils, where no
other form of plant life can exist. The Indians of the
desert regions used the plant as a physic, and it outranks
<i>Rhamnus californica</i> in this respect. The mission friars overlooked
this plant for the reason that none of them ventured
that far into the desert, valuing their lives above everything
else.</p>
<p>The infusion obtained from the plant was used in very
minimum doses, and when unable to do that, a small branch
was cut and a very small piece was chewed by the constipated
person.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h4>RHAMNUS CALIFORNICA
<br />(<i>Ind. Hoon-wet-que-wa</i>)</h4>
<p>American Coffee Berry. Its habitat is the canyons of high
mountain ranges along waterway banks.</p>
<p>The bark was stripped off the trees, shade-dried and then
ground in a <i>ca-wish-pat-os-vaal</i>, meaning the stone mortar
and pestle generally used in those days, and even by druggists
today, though made of different material. The prepared
powder was used to a great extent at full strength in cases of
constipation, and was administered in well-measured doses,
but not in excess.</p>
<p>Owing to its medicinal properties this tree-plant was introduced
into European countries where it gradually became
the outstanding cathartic of all.</p>
<p>And this is the <i>Rhamnus californica</i>, the medicine of the
Indians, named by Junipero De Serra <i>Cascara sagrada</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Sacred
Bark.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Kidneys.</h3>
<h4>EQUISETUM HYEMALE
<br />(<i>Ind. Po-po-ot</i>)</h4>
<p>Its habitat is confined to swampy lands. This plant is very
fond of water, and attains a very vigorous growth under these
conditions. Due to its aquatic nature, the plant, when fully
matured, was gathered, shade-dried and an infusion made
which was used solely in the treatment of prostate gland
trouble. (American Horsetail)</p>
<h4>EPHEDRA
<br />(<i>Ind. Tut-tut</i>)</h4>
<p>Its habitat is the desert lands of California, northwestern
Arizona, and Nevada.</p>
<p>This evergreen, shrubby plant was held in high esteem by
all the Indians, and a good supply of it was always kept on
hand for general use. The infusion made from it was used
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
regularly to flush the kidneys. The tea is of a very delicious
taste. A person cannot help liking it, and it also helps to
purify the blood. (American Tea of the Indian)</p>
<h4>PELLAEA ATROPURPUREA
<br />(<i>Ind. Cala-wala</i>)</h4>
<p>American Purple Cliff Brake Fern. Its habitat: the high
mountain ranges. This useful little fern grows abundantly
on most of the limestone formations and is seldom found
anywhere else. Like <i>Ephedra</i> it makes a delicious tea, which
is used more or less for the same purpose, to flush the
kidneys and to tone and thin the blood in severely hot
summer weather as a preventative against sunstroke.</p>
<h3>Blood pressure, sunstroke.</h3>
<h4>ERIOGONUM ELONGATUM
<br />(<i>Ind. Te-ve-na-wa</i>)</h4>
<p>This plant is an inhabitant of the Mojave Desert. There
are two different varieties, one of them being quite common
on arid lands and side hills along our coastal highways. The
other is the best, however, and, as a blood tonic, compares
very favorably in medicinal worth with all others recommended.</p>
<p>The latter was used by the Indian for special cases of high
blood pressure and hardening of the arteries.</p>
<p>It was generally used by Indian runners, and taken before
and after a long-distance run over rough country.</p>
<h3>Sedatives.</h3>
<h4>VERONICA OFFICINALIS
<br />(<i>Ind. Ca-wish-hubel</i>)</h4>
<p>American Speedwell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h4>MENTHA SPICATA
<br />(<i>Ind. Ga-vish-ho-ba-jat</i>)</h4>
<p>American Garden Spearmint. Habitat, the lower marshy
coastal regions.</p>
<h4>ILYSANTHUS BRACHIATUS
<br />(<i>Ind. Samat-hubel</i>)</h4>
<p>American Mountain False Pennyroyal.</p>
<h4>MENTHA CANADENSIS
<br />(<i>Ind. Samat</i>)</h4>
<p>Both <i>Ilysanthus</i> (above) and <i>Mentha Canadensis</i> inhabit
the high mid-coastal ranges and are frequently found lining
the borders of mountain streams in beautiful settings of wild
ferns. (American Mint)</p>
<h4>MICROMERIA DOUGLASII
<br />(<i>Ind. Ya-mish-hubel</i>)</h4>
<p>Mint Family. A rare plant and found only in a few localities
on the mid-coastal ranges, as in Orange County, San Juan
Capistrano, at Hot Springs, situated on the southern slopes
of the Trabuco mountains, Los Angeles County, Fish Canyon,
Pasadena in Santa Barbara County, the heavy woodlands
of Montecito Valley and in the Old Spanish Grand Rancho,
San Leandro. It is also found northward as far as San Francisco
at Angel Islands. The infusion was taken to soothe the
nervous system in cases of insomnia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h3>Catarrh of the head and nasal chambers.</h3>
<h4>PLATANUS OCCIDENTALIS
<br />(<i>Ind. Ci-vil</i>)</h4>
<p>American Sycamore. It is an inhabitant of the California
mountain ranges. The underside of its leaves bears a very
fine yellowish moss, which the beautiful little hummingbirds
like to use for building their tiny nests. In fact, they
prefer it to any other material on account of its extreme
softness.</p>
<p>These leaves are valuable as an effective cure for old
chronic cases of catarrh, when the catarrh has passed into
internal ulcers, which continually discharge material of an
offensive odor.</p>
<p>The moss scraped from the underside of the leaves, carefully
and patiently enough to have a sufficient supply to
compound it with the dry powdered yolks of the eggs of
quail and an infusion of <i>Andromeda polifolia</i> was also made
and used as a nasal douche, to cleanse the conduits, followed
afterwards by sniffing the powdered compound before retiring
for the night.</p>
<h4>HELENIUM AUTUMNALE&mdash;HELENIUM NUDIFLORUM
<br />(<i>Ind. Pe-bah</i>)</h4>
<p>American Sneeze-Weed. Both inhabit swamps and mountain
springs.</p>
<h4>ANDROMEDA POLIFOLIA
<br />(<i>Ind. Ho-bef-zo-bal</i>)</h4>
<p>American Moorwort. This is found only at very high
mountain altitudes.</p>
<h3>Toothache and pyorrhea.</h3>
<h4>ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM
<br />(<i>Ind. Pas-wat</i>)</h4>
<p>American Yarrow. This plant bears a strong resemblance
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
to the Wood Betony, which is poisonous, and both may, in
their wild state, be found side by side in the same locality.
It is indigenous to the mid-coastal range woodlands.</p>
<p>Persons suffering from a severe toothache can cut the tips
of the leaves of <i>Achillea millefolium</i>, roll them into a small
pellet and insert it into the cavity of the aching tooth. You
will be surprised how quickly the pain disappears.</p>
<h4>ERIOGONUM
<br />(<i>Ind. Pas-vaat</i>)</h4>
<p>This inhabitant of the Mojave Desert, with its golden yellow
flowers, is a treat to the true lover of nature. Its blooming
season is in its full glory during the month of October
when everything else in the way of flowering trees and shrubs
is lying dormant. Thousands of acres in the desert may be
seen carpeted with this golden color, blending with that of
autumnal foliage and geological soil formation which also
glows in many tints, offering wonders of inspiration to the
artist&mdash;the greatest interpreter of the works of nature next
to the botanist, geologist and naturalist.</p>
<p>For centuries <i>Pas-vaat</i> has been used by the Indians to keep
the roots of the teeth and the gums in a state of health. Whenever
pyorrhea was present and the teeth threatened to become
loose, an infusion of the flowers and leaves of the plant
was made and regularly used as a mouthwash. Although its
taste is very bitter, holding the liquid in the mouth for a
few minutes daily will prevent and cure pyorrhea and tend
to the firm setting of the teeth.</p>
<h4>QUERCUS RUBRA
<br />(<i>Ind. Qui-neel</i>)</h4>
<p>American Red Oak. The juice obtained from the bark is
a very efficient means for straightening and setting loose
teeth, but it has no effect on pyorrhea.</p>
<h4>PERSEA and VANILLA PLANIFOLIA</h4>
<p>American Avocado, or Alligator Pear. Our Indian brothers
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
of the North Central American states use the seeds of the
avocado in the treatment of pyorrhea, although only in the
form of powder. It is very good and efficient for toothache,
as is also an infusion made of the vanilla bean.</p>
<h3>Fever and chills.</h3>
<h4>ROSA GALLICA
<br />(<i>Ind. Mal-va-pol</i>)</h4>
<p>American <i>Malva rosa</i>. This rose tree has to some extent
been the subject of discussion among some of our botanical
explorers and the result was always one of indecision.</p>
<p>Now let us look back a few years before the founding of
the California Missions, and thus settle the dispute for all
time. Twelve miles eastward of the Santa Barbara Mission
is a small village by the name of Carpenteria, and at one
time, this village was one of the largest Indian settlements
in existence.</p>
<p>Before the arrival of the mission friars this place was a
dense forest of the giant elm, <i>Ulmus pubescens</i>, a tree which
is very soft and easy to work and the Indian settlement became
the scene of great boat-building activity. The biggest
and best trees were selected, hewed out and shaped into boats,
and their boats were later used to navigate from Santa Barbara
across the channel to Santa Rosa Island and other points.
The Indians traded with the inhabitants of these islands, and
thus they attained a great deal of magnetic iron in exchange
for the wild products of the Pacific coast mainland. The
magnetic iron was of general use among the Indians, being
made into hammers, axes, scraping and cutting knives, fighting
weapons, etc., all made in true Indian mechanical design.</p>
<p>Other valuable rock materials were also traded for, such
as obsidian for arrowheads and small mortars, metates made
of the volcanic rock found on the islands, and also ironwood.
These were all materials much preferred by the Indians to
those of the mainland, which were rather unfit to shape
into stone utensils because they did not have the proper
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
cleavage. The Santa Barbara mountain ranges offered none of
these materials&mdash;only the minerals, Ullmannite, Oligocene
rock and red jasper which sometimes served as passably fair
substitutes.</p>
<p>Referring again to the trade articles of the island of Santa
Rosa, the Indians, like their white brothers, liked to change
and use different medicines. While navigating the rough sea
across the Santa Barbara channel in their little boats, some
of them would sometimes catch cold from getting wet and
being exposed to cold winds. When reaching the islands some
would have a high fever and chills, and then aid was given
them in the form of <i>Malva rosa</i>, this being the plant used to
break up the fever. And it will do so if properly administered.
The Indians had so much faith in its value that they
brought some of the seeds to the mainland where they were
planted.</p>
<p>Later, on its introduction among other Indian tribes of the
coastal belt, the plant found its way north- and southward
until the coming of the California mission founders. They
learned of the plant&rsquo;s medicinal value through Indian information,
and were only too glad to adopt it for their own
use&mdash;that plant and many others which proved superior to
those brought by them from Europe and which they then
discarded.</p>
<p>Thereupon the friars adapted themselves to the care and
use of the herbs of the Indians.</p>
<p>This is the story of the <i>Malva rosa</i> after which the island
of Santa Barbara bears its name <i>Santa Rosa</i>, or &ldquo;Holy Rose,&rdquo;
and botanically <i>Rosa gallica</i>.</p>
<h3>Fractures.</h3>
<h4>ULMUS PUBESCENS
<br />(<i>Ind. He-wa-wa</i>)</h4>
<p>American Elm. We have seen that the beautiful elm was
used by choice as a light, soft boat-building material. It played
also a very useful and important part in the adjustment and
healing of broken and fractured arms or legs. The work
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
was very simple and effective. The patient was placed in bed,
or what was known in those days as the <i>un-wet</i>, meaning
bearskin mattress, to lie down and rest till the Indian runners
returned from the forest with the stripped bark of the
elm, which was very carefully selected and had to be free of
woody knots, with the inner side of the bark as smooth as
silk. These large strips were cut to mould and fit clear around
the broken bones, then tied with wet buckskin. This was
done to allow contraction of the buckskin with that of the
green juicy bark of the elm, while the fevered and swollen
joint absorbed the juice of the bark.</p>
<p>Care was taken to add more juice extracted from the tree
to the bark strips to prevent quick contraction which would
be very painful, due to swelling and counterpressure from
the drying bark. The time involved in healing broken bones
could well be considered two thirds of the time taken under
the hands of modern skilled surgeons.</p>
<p>In parts of the country where the elm wasn&rsquo;t available a
freshly killed rabbit, its skin quickly removed and slipped
onto the broken joint served equally as well, only it required
more time to heal.</p>
<h3>Blood specific, purifier and tonic.</h3>
<h4>FOUQUIERIA SPLENDENS
<br />(<i>Ind. Gaiesh-pohl</i>)</h4>
<p>American Desert Candlewood. Spanish, <i>Ocotillo</i>. This
plant&rsquo;s habitat is the southeastern wings of the Mojave
Desert, and the locality best suited to its growth is Borrego
Valley at the northern border of San Diego County. This
great valley, at one time very rich and fertile, was used by the
Indian tribes of Chief Hobo-yak of Ca-we for the raising of
considerable livestock. This particular spot commanded an
extensive view of the desert territory, as well as the mountain
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
peaks surrounding it. From the top, a clear view could be obtained
toward north, northeast and southeast to the Mexican
border, and it afforded a natural fortification for the aggressive
Ca-we Indians.</p>
<p>There still remain a few of the sand-dune forts heavily
overgrown with creosote bushes. These forts are deeply recessed,
formed in the shape of a horseshoe, its outlet serving
as an entrance at the same time. Pointing northward toward
the high mountain ranges, the graves, or burialground
of the Indians, are located just outside of the fort and a few
feet to the left from the outlet on a well-arranged plot of
ground.</p>
<p>The interment was simple. After a grave had been dug,
it was filled with dry wood and set on fire until a good bed
of charcoal was attained; after which, the defunct together
with his belongings was placed upon it and left to burn as
the grave was covered.</p>
<p>Cremation took place slowly but surely.</p>
<p>Little evidence was left for the grave robber or the anthropologist.
And still less for the archaeologist, as the defunct&rsquo;s
pottery and rock mortars also were disposed of by
being broken into thousands of pieces, and then scattered
over the grave.</p>
<p>There is more to be said about this historical valley in
that it was the main artery of caravan travel of the intrepid
American and Mexican pioneers, and of the Spanish explorers,
who all in turn were met and held up by the Indians
for information. Those not offering resistance were allowed
to pass through the territory unmolested&mdash;provided, of course,
they wouldn&rsquo;t hang around the valley.</p>
<p>However, quite a number of bloody battles took place
there, between Indians and whites, as the latter, having had
some experience with hostile Apaches when crossing the
desert, misunderstood the signals of the Ca-we Indians.
Instead of waiting to see what they wanted, the leading
scouts of the caravan ordered every man to stand by and, as
the Indians came near, they opened fire on them. This didn&rsquo;t
prove of benefit to the pioneers and only resulted in disaster,
thus putting an end to their journey.</p>
<p>Even to this day many of their belongings are kept well
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
secured in the bosom of Borrego Valley. Sand dunes uncovered
now and then by desert winds prove there is a possibility
of their all being recovered in time and preserved as
historical relics of days gone by.</p>
<p>At the northwest end of the valley are the historical camp
grounds of De Anza, the Spanish explorer, who was the only
one ever known to have put up camp in the valley in those
days.</p>
<p>And this marked the beginning of darker days for the Indians.
First came the Spaniards, then the Mexicans and last
the American gringos. They all passed there, but none had
the least suspicion of what was to take place in the future.
De Anza, while resting up for a short period, explored among
the surrounding mountains in search of a pass which would
lead westward. In this the Indians helped him by pointing
toward the Pacific coast. De Anza reported to his superiors
the finding of emeralds, but in this he was mistaken as the
precious stones found in those mountains are mostly tourmalines
in a great variety of tints, including green. This
probably accounts for De Anza&rsquo;s naming them emeralds. They
also occur in red, pink, yellow, white and black, with spodumene
crystals in violet and purple.</p>
<p>The floor of the valley also yields carnelian milky quartz,
bloodstones, as well as fossilized wood and jasper. These
beautiful precious stones have found a place among the
gems of the world and are well-known among mineralogists.
In the traditional history of the Indians, De Anza is still remembered
for the discipline and control he kept over his
men, a fact which greatly facilitated his progress. And his
goodwill and kindness toward the Indians were of the purest
humaneness, standing out brightly as attributes of genuine
manhood. Very few Spaniards could boast of such qualities&mdash;they
ordinarily were brutal, and their history was written in
blood in those days.</p>
<p>The Mexican soldiers who arrived later, by way of this
valley, committed frightful excesses among the Indians, even
assaulting and outraging the fair daughters of Ca-we. A horrible
tragedy marked the sequel to those days of terror and
bloodshed.</p>
<p>Then, in the rising dust on the northeastern horizon appeared
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
a newcomer, General Kearny, in command of his
gallant dragoons, following the course De Anza had taken.
He had no trouble making the pass as his men were under
strict military discipline and the blue uniforms worn by officers
and troopers caused much admiration among the Indians.
Little did they know, however, that behind this army
was a power and authority which could be exercised without
cause or provocation in the name of the government of
the United States&mdash;and that was exactly General Kearny&rsquo;s
mission: to retake the lands held by the Mexicans as their
own at San Pasqual. He became engaged in a heated battle
with Mexican soldiers and civilians and his casualties were
so heavy that he faced defeat. As a last resort, he appealed to
the Indians chiefs for help, and the Ca-we Indians, remembering
only too well the atrocities and brutalities committed
upon their women by the soldiers of Mexico, granted the
General&rsquo;s request and dispatched five hundred warriors to aid
General Kearny.</p>
<p>Arriving at the battlefield, the Indian braves attacked the
Mexicans from all sides, thus saving the day for General
Kearny who had but a few of his men left.</p>
<p>As to the kind of report he made to the War Department,
and whether he took all the credit for having won this bloody
battle whereas, by rights, the Indians alone were responsible
for the victory, is not known to us. But we have every reason
to believe that the report was in his favor in order to shield
the command from embarrassment were it to become known
that Indian aid and tactics had been the deciding factor. At
any rate, up to the present time, Indian records don&rsquo;t show
any letter of acknowledgment ever having been received
from the United States Government for the service rendered
General Kearny.</p>
<p>Instead of receiving at least a &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; they were
from that time on looked upon as &ldquo;easy,&rdquo; believing anything
that was told them&mdash;and this was proved to their own satisfaction
in 1851-52. No doubt some of our fellow citizens
do not know what this means. Therefore, to elucidate a little,
let me say that this was the time when a benevolent government
sent a very able regiment of politicians out here
in command of a few army engineers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>These engineers executed their commission in a first-rate
manner and negotiated and signed 18 treaties with the signatures
also of 400 Indian chiefs. And the Indians turned
over more than one hundred million acres of fertile lands
to the government, leaving a reserve of ten million acres to
the Indians. The larger acreage was to be paid for, as per
duly signed agreement, at the rate of $1.25 per acre, and to
this day the Indian is still waiting for it. The politicians,
however, lost no time but took over as much as they could
of these rich Indian lands and eventually the entire open
country was known as the Ranch of Senator &ldquo;This,&rdquo; or Senator,
Congressman, or Colonel &ldquo;That.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the longest road has a turning was proved by the battle
of San Pasqual: it opened the Indians&rsquo; eyes to many things&mdash;such
as, that had they but stayed out of it or used our forces
otherwise, a different story would be told. The Indians were
expelled from the Borrego Valley. We need no explanation
here that they were good strategists and fighters and their
holdings there were needed for the purpose mentioned. The
valley has been donated by these patriotic and liberal politicians
to the State of California and, by law, has become its
property, and a state park.</p>
<p>And from high on its mountain top, the men of Ca-we
may look down into the valley and think of its past history
with an ache in their hearts. Only a few make a yearly trip
there, for the purpose of gathering a goodly supply of medicinal
plants and the <i>Ocotillo</i> or Indian Poinsettia Candlewood.</p>
<h3>Blood tonic.</h3>
<h4>SALIX WASHINGTONIA
<br />(<i>Ind. Ke-cham-ka</i>)</h4>
<p>American Willow Tree. This is a common inhabitant of
most of our swamps and rivers and is occasionally met with
far inland. Like the elm tree, it is very fond of water, and
both species may be found growing together in the desert
or dry mountain gorges. We should, therefore, always look
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
for such places when in want of water&mdash;for it is sure to be
close to the surface and can be had by digging a few feet
underground.</p>
<p>The Indians, when traveling across country, always stopped
at such places where these trees were growing, and water was
obtainable very quickly in sufficient quantities for domestic
use. Don&rsquo;t get discouraged if you don&rsquo;t find water seepages
on the surface. You must remember that the elm and the
willow growing around that ancient fountain consume most
of the water coming upward to the surface.</p>
<p>These sources of liquid supply were once the watering
places for migratory birds flying east or northward, and by
means of their droppings these trees became habitants of
these wild regions.</p>
<p>Concerning the medicinal value of the willow tree, the
Indians would take the leaves and pound them in the stone
mortar, after which the pulp was put into water where it
was allowed to remain a few hours. The liquid was then
taken like any other beverage, the patient first having taken
a bath to prevent a cold, and to keep the blood at the proper
temperature.</p>
<p>The tea has a decidedly bitter taste. During the dormant
season of the trees when the leaves were not available, the
bark was stripped from the tree and served the purpose just
as well.</p>
<h4>TABARDILLO
<br />(<i>Ind. Pees-wel</i>)</h4>
<p>This strawberry-leaved plant grew in our time in abundance
throughout the lower coastal ranges and valleys; but
when the white pioneers in the early days began clearing the
land for agricultural purposes, it marked the destruction of
this and other valuable plants also.</p>
<p>Therefore, this plant is now totally extinct in the lower
coastal plains, but still available in a few remote places in
the higher ranges, where it is gathered by the Indians for
home use.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Tea is made from the plant, and all the members of the
family partake of it for at least one full month each year.</p>
<p>The infusion made from the root is of a clear, wine-red
color, and is extremely beneficial as a blood tonic.</p>
<h4>HOSACKIA GLABRA
<br />(<i>Ind. Su-cot</i>)</h4>
<p>American Deer Grass. Inhabiting the high coastal ranges,
this beautiful little flowering grass when in bloom, during
the month of May, appears to be almost a massive bouquet
of carnations among the greenery of the mountain slopes.</p>
<p>Deer are frequently found foraging in places where the
<i>Hosackia glabra</i> grows, as they are very fond of the grass, and
the Indians, as a rule, pick such localities to hunt in.</p>
<p>The infusion made from the plant is rather aromatic and,
if taken regularly, it will help to build up the blood.</p>
<h3>Antidote.</h3>
<h4>PIPERACEA
<br />(<i>Ind. Chu-co-pat</i>)</h4>
<p>Habitat, rich northern mountain slopes. It grows mostly
in underbrush, but is sometimes found on cleared land. It
was gathered, dried and then ground in the rock mortar to
a very fine powder, for use when our people exchanged poisoned
arrows for bullets on the field of battle. Our poisoned
arrows were more effective than bullets, as a scratch would
send an enemy to eternal rest. Today we still use this plant
in the treatment of trachoma, and rattlesnake, black-widow
and scorpion bites. (American Pepper Plant)</p>
<h3>Poison.</h3>
<h4>ESCHSCHOLTZIA CALIFORNICA
<br />(<i>Ind. Tee-snnat</i>)</h4>
<p>American Golden Poppy. The true native flower of our
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
western domain&mdash;the flower of the beautiful, rich golden
color. However, being a poisonous plant, the poppy fields
were of no use to the good morals and medical practice
of the Indian doctors in the days gone by. But the notorious
witch-doctor, having more of the devil in him than of anything
else, made general use of this plant to compound some
of his poisonous medicines in his irregular and evil practice.
This may be strange to learn, but we had its counterpart
among other races&mdash;the white race included&mdash;where
witchcraft with its incantations, love potions and straight
poisoning of humans played quite a role. And so it was
here among the Indians. For instance, if a woman became
enamoured of a certain man and the object of her affections
paid no attention to her advances, whether his regards were
already placed in some other quarter, or for other reasons,
this was sufficient for the woman who, having had her immoral
desires thwarted, resorted to the witch-doctor. He
would compound a preparation with the poppy as one of
its main ingredients. This was then given to the innocent
victim with the help of a second or third party, either in
a solid or liquid form, and in less than twenty-four hours after
partaking of it the poor fellow&rsquo;s mentality became befogged
and powerless, and was thus easily controlled by the evil
woman.</p>
<p>When such a case was brought to the attention of the chief
of the tribe, orders were given to bring the malefactors in
to be tried before the rest of the chiefs.</p>
<p>The leaders of this evil practice, if found guilty, were
condemned to exile, and, under a guard of warriors, taken far
out into the desolate desert with the death penalty hanging
over them, should they ever return.</p>
<p>The poisoned victim was placed in the hands of the tribal
doctor who gave him an antidote which counteracted the
poison given by the witch&mdash;something which no white doctor
has been able to do in spite of his knowledge of medical
science and chemistry. Cases of such nature have happened
among Indians and yet the patient&rsquo;s normal state of mind
and health was restored.</p>

<h4>ASTRAGALUS MOLLISSIMUS
<br />(<i>Ind. Po-gat</i>)</h4>
<p>American Locoweed. A good many years ago this poisonous
plant was powdered and used to dope race horses, as the
Spaniards were very fond of this sport of kings. And since
they were the great landowners when the Americans began
to come in, this sport became more popular than ever. Money
was wagered against large tracts of the Mexican-Spanish lands
in behalf of their favorite horses, and at times amounted to
many hundreds of acres of the richest and most fertile land.
It was this very poisonous <i>Astragalus mollissimus</i> that was
responsible for the transference of large Spanish and Mexican
grants into the hands of Americans.</p>
<p>The Indians, being well-informed and cognizant of the
fraud being perpetrated at the expense of their good friends,
revealed to them the tactics employed and, for a small compensation,
offered to recover for them some of their losses.
This offer was gladly accepted and, in consequence, the Mexican
landowner would again challenge the former American
winner, whereupon a date was set for the race.</p>
<p>Under cover of night the Indian would watch over the
horse that was to run until the day of the race, when he would
appear in order to redeem his promise. Although this may
cause surprise, it was only a little Indian trick, playing its
part of revenge on deceiving, dishonest persons.</p>
<p>It was clean, honest revenge, not requiring the poisoning
of one of our most highly valued domestic animals, and this
is how it was done.</p>
<p>The Indian rider concealed under the bosom of his buckskin
shirt two pieces of skin, one from a fresh bearskin and
the other from that of a mountain lion. When both riders
were lined up for the race and right at the moment of taking
off, the Indian, with a quick jerk, would pull both skins&mdash;which
were hanging on a string&mdash;from under his shirt and
his opponent&rsquo;s horse, quickly scenting them, would stop and
balk, throw up his head and look fearfully around in all
directions.</p>
<p>The Indian made the wire easily and thus the other horse&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
deceiving owner lost the race and also his ill-gotten gains,
proving again that crime, in any form, doesn&rsquo;t pay in the long
run.</p>
<h3>Hair tonic, hair and scalp diseases.</h3>
<h4>LARREA MEXICANA
<br />(<i>Ind. Ato-col</i>)</h4>
<p>American Creosote Bush. I have mentioned the use of this
shrubby bush in the beginning for another disease. It was
used by the Indians for various maladies which I shall describe
toward the end of the book.</p>
<p>The plant was one of the principal herbs used to eradicate
dandruff and the infusion, when used as a hair-wash once a
week for a period of about two months, will be found enough
to rid a person of dandruff thoroughly. Its one drawback, if
any, is that it will make the hair coarse, although on the
other hand, very strong. It was also used as a disinfectant
and deodorizer of bodily odors by sponging the body with
the full-strength infusion.</p>
<h4>LOPHOPHORA WILLIAMSII
<br />(<i>Ind. Am-mool</i>)</h4>
<p>American Desert Agave or Button Root. Indigenous to the
Mojave Desert, San Bernardino County, East Riverside
County and the Borrego Valley situated at the northern end
of San Diego County, and thence southeastward to the Mexican
border. The Indians made special trips to places where
this plant grew, and spent several weeks at a time in harvesting
it. The root is very important and yields the proper ingredients
to compound one of the finest hair tonics known&mdash;greatly
superior to the best on the American market of today.</p>
<p>After gathering the plants, the Indians roasted the leaves
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
in covered underground rock pits. After this was done they
underwent a sun-drying process, following which they were
cut into small square pieces and stored away for winter use
in hermetically sealed earthen <i>ay-as</i>.</p>
<p>The plant was put to many other uses which I shall not
divulge at this time, as it would probably invite total extermination
of the desert agave, as occurred in the case of
the bison and the messenger dove.</p>
<h3>Ringworms and scalp germs of the hair roots.</h3>
<h4>MICRAPELIS MICRACARPA
<br />(<i>Ind. Yal</i>)</h4>
<p>American Thorny Cucumber. This beautiful vine is very
common through the lower and upper coastal ranges. Wherever
you may go you will see the thorny cucumber. It is very
bitter to the taste and the seeds are very pretty, running into
the various shades of white, yellow, gray, black, olive-green,
brown, and red.</p>
<p>In the &rsquo;90s the white people discovered that they could be
worked into portieres, hanging ornaments, etc., as they looked
so beautiful and the fad became so strong that young and
old would search for these seeds all over the country with
the result that the plant became almost extinct, the usual
net result when the white man took a fancy to certain plants
or animals. However, in this instance, kind Mother Nature
hid a few seeds away among and under the carpet of autumn
leaves which in time replaced the destruction wrought by
the white man.</p>
<p>One should know that we, the so-called savages, never destroyed
wantonly, and when we gathered the flowers, seeds,
leaves and bark of plants, we did so for a useful purpose, not
to strew them along the highways as the custom is among
certain humans of today.</p>
<p><i>Micrapelis micracarpa</i> was used in the treatment of ringworm
in the epidermis. Juices extracted from the rind of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
thorny cucumber were rubbed into afflicted parts&mdash;a sure and
effective remedy.</p>
<p>For the treatment of diseased scalps and hair roots the oil
extracted from the seeds is massaged into the scalp and thus
prevents the falling out of the hair.</p>
<p>The juice of <i>Micrapelis micracarpa</i> will remove human
bloodstains, one of the most difficult stains to remove. The
Indian made quite frequent use of it&mdash;when returning from
the battlefield or a hunting trip&mdash;to remove such stains from
his buckskin clothes.</p>
<h3>The soap of the Indian.</h3>
<h4>CUCURBITA FOETIDISSIMA
<br />(<i>Ind. Meh-hish</i>)</h4>
<p>American Wild Gourd. This plant, inhabiting the arid
soils of the coastal plains, is very hardy and at its best
in worthless ground unsuitable for agricultural purposes.
Thanks to Mother Nature, by thriving in otherwise dead
soils, it was assured of continuous preservation.</p>
<p>The Indians regarded it highly as being useful in what
washing they had to do toward keeping their buckskin clothes
and blankets clean. Very soon after the vandals from Spain
invaded our country, they adopted this plant in place of their
greasy soaps. When the gourds were fully matured they were
gathered and put away in the shade to dry for winter use.
For the day&rsquo;s washing, one gourd was put in about ten gallons
of water to help bleach the clothes, while large, square
pieces were cut from the roots (which grow to an immense
size) and were used as root soap bars for rubbing the clothes
laid on a smooth log or a flat rock. Another plant similarly
used was the fibrous bulb of the</p>
<h4>CHLOROGALUM POMERIDIANUM
<br />(<i>Ind. Mo-cee</i>)</h4>
<p>A member of the Lily family, known as Soap Plant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h4>SAPONARIA OFFICIANALIS
<br />(<i>Ind. Yu-look-ut-hish</i>)</h4>
<p>American Soapwort. Inhabits the woodlands of the lower
coast regions. The juice extracted from the roots of this plant
makes an excellent hair tonic and cleanser, giving the hair
a beautiful, brilliant gloss and, as a shampoo, it exceeds
most of the modern hair tonics which, in my opinion, are
more or less injurious to the hair roots due to an excess of
alcohol in the preparations. Blooming season: May to June.</p>
<p>Its leaves were also of much use in cases of pains of the
spleen. They were ground into a pulp and applied as a poultice-plaster
directly where the pain was, and kept there for
from three to four hours.</p>
<h4>BRODIAEA
<br />(<i>Ind. Meh-wahot</i>)</h4>
<p>Is an inhabitant of the lower coastal regions, and is one of
the other plants serviceable for making an excellent shampoo
for the hair, the bulb and flowers being used for the purpose.
Blooms from March to May.</p>
<h3>Protection against lightning.</h3>
<h4>CEANOTHUS DIVARICATUS and PINUS SABINIANA
<br />(<i>Ind. O-Oot</i>)<span class="hst"> (<i>Ind. Wa-at</i>)</span></h4>
<p>The California Lilac&mdash;Spanish <i>Chaparral</i>&mdash;an inhabitant
of the mountain ranges, blooms like the common lilac and
is very beautiful.</p>
<p>Attracting every nature lover, this gigantic shrub is possessed
of a strange power, which up to the present has escaped
attention, due to its having been kept secret among
the Indians for centuries.</p>
<p>As I am writing Indian legends through botany, I, for the
first time, shall reveal the virtues of this shrub and it should
prove of the greatest interest to those engaged in scientific
research, especially in geology and botanical chemistry. And
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
if the shrub is used as the Indians used it&mdash;and still do&mdash;it
will help to safeguard life when thunder and lightning are at
their worst at timber line of high mountainsides and peaks.</p>
<p>These monumental cones were at one time, in the early
Archean period, surcharged with volcanic activity, which was
responsible for the enormous iron deposits stored in the
bowels of the earth. Electrical storms, being attracted by the
iron, burst at times there with terrific violence, causing a
truly phenomenal disturbance; while lightning bolts strike
the iron bodies, completely magnetizing them, turning them
gradually into the mineral, magnetic iron.</p>
<p>Now, let us bear in mind that cone-bearing pines and the
<i>Chaparral</i> grow side by side on and over these magnetic iron
deposits. Of the two, the pine seldom escapes destruction
whereas the <i>Chaparral</i> deflects lightning. At the harvest season
of the pine nuts, when these storms were very frequent,
precaution had to be taken against the danger of being
struck by lightning, and the <i>Chaparral</i> was the tree chosen
in the pine forest by the Indians as furnishing both safety
and shelter.</p>
<p>Now, some of our Red fellow men, through ignorance and
a belief in miracles, were superstitious and quite sincere in
their belief in the efficiency possessed by the magnetic
iron mineral, and in its inherent supernatural powers to
guard their homes against prowlers and thieves. So, much
of it was gathered after its discovery and placed inside the
homes to protect them from such intruders. Therefore, whenever
a man was known to be in the possession of this mineral
he became the object of much reverence and respect by
wrongdoers, the belief being that the magnetic iron attracts
and draws to it all other particles of nonmagnetic iron. By
the same token, if they entered strange premises, the same
thing would happen to them and they would be held until
the rightful owner appeared.</p>
<p>The author of <i>Chi-nich-nich</i>, Dr. John P. Harrington, of
the Department of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution,
found himself against a wall when he wrote something about
this &ldquo;wizard&rdquo; mineral under its Indian name without a sample
from his Indian informant, Mr. Albanes. Dr. Harrington
was unable to give a firsthand description and had no definite
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
idea of what the mineral actually was until he requested me
to revise his work, a thing I did gladly at the printing office
in Santa Ana, Calif.</p>
<p>Later on, when my opinion was asked regarding the book
I, of course, drew my own conclusions and withheld any
criticism. This I did, not deeming it wise to make any remarks
about parts of the work which did not represent the
true phases of Indian life, for, as I held the key that would
correct those parts, any criticism from me would only have
led to my being questioned as to my knowledge of things
which I didn&rsquo;t feel at liberty to divulge.</p>
<p>Accordingly, my identification of the &ldquo;wizard stone&rdquo; broke
up an expensive Smithsonian expedition which was to be
made by a group of geologists, with all its branches well-represented,
in search of magnetic iron. Now, this is a mineral
which has some commercial value in the electrical field,
the steel industries and in the manufacture of scientific instruments,
although some charlatans, like some of my Indian
brothers, claim the mineral possesses supernatural powers
and the so-called lodestone is sold today to a good many
people as a talisman.</p>
<p>This lodestone is nothing more than common magnetic
iron, yellow in color due to the large amount of sulphur in
the mineral. The silver-gray magnetic ore which was the Indian&rsquo;s
&ldquo;wizard stone&rdquo; derives its color from the arsenic it
contains. Furthermore, many other spurious contrivances are
being sold, not to Indians but to white people of even very
superior intelligence and P. T. Barnum fell far short in his
estimate of the number of people just waiting to fall into the
snare of deception, with his famous remark that &ldquo;a sucker
is born every minute.&rdquo; Every second would be nearer the
truth.</p>
<p>By personal investigation which I made I found that some
of these deluded victims, men and women both, carry upon
their persons lodestones for &ldquo;luck,&rdquo; whereas others think
that by wearing them concealed close to the flesh it gives
them a strong magnetic personality and thereby they command
the attention they desire from others.</p>
<p>This is not likely to happen. You can magnetize your body,
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
to be sure, but not this way. The right way is the way of
the Indians of wisdom, nature&rsquo;s way. If you are getting sluggish,
low in vitality and vigor, it simply means that the battery-cells
of your body are low and need recharging. Civilization
has to some extent deprived us of this great body builder
and has isolated us until the flesh of our feet does not make
contact with the vast electrical currents of Mother Nature.
To receive any benefits from this natural resource you must
not wear shoes in the spring or early summer months, and,
weather permitting, go to some lonely place where you are
sure there won&rsquo;t be any interference by the authorities, remove
your clothing and then lie flat on the ground with
your muscles well relaxed.</p>
<p>While doing this, dismiss from your mind everything
which would cause you worry. Slowly but surely you will
find yourself to be a different man if this is repeated yearly.
Thus you will have learned to &ldquo;magnetize&rdquo; your soul and
preserve yourself for the many years before you, as most
Indians do.</p>
<p>How to be free from daily annoying trivialities, which only
serve to undermine one&rsquo;s health, weaken one&rsquo;s body and
render one an easy prey to disease and misery, the Indian
understood thoroughly. Instead, he cultivated poise, and
reached such perfection that he became the envy of the white
race in that respect.</p>
<h3>Antivenin for rattlesnake and tarantula bites.</h3>
<h4>DATURA METELOIDES.
<br />(<i>Ind. Qui-qui-sa-waal</i>)</h4>
<p>American Jimson Weed. This plant is an inhabitant of
the California coastal region and is not particular as to the
nature of the soil or its fertility, but thrives anywhere. This
tuberous, bushy plant is highly narcotic and when the leaves
are properly cured they can be used either in the form of
tea or smoked, but withal, very sparingly, since an overdose
may very likely cause one to be committed to an insane
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
asylum, as it is a rank poison and its effect may even land
one in an undertaker&rsquo;s mortuary. Therefore, my advice is
to leave it alone.</p>
<p>My Indian brothers, being unable to give correct information
to hard-shelled scientists and writers through a poor
knowledge of the English language, were made objects of
criticism, and science deliberately declined to acknowledge
the medicinal value of this cousin to Datura stramonium
which in modern medical practice is of great value at the
present time.</p>
<p>Considering, however, the value and uses of <i>Datura
meteloides</i>, I assert that this decision was very irregular and
out of all proportion as to what it was intended. We know
that everything can be abused, yet some of our Indian brothers
who wished to live in ignorance and superstition had a
perfect right to do so. In truth, it wasn&rsquo;t so with all Indians
and there were really some great minds amongst them.</p>
<p>When, for instance, the Chinaman wishes to see the beautiful
lotus and cherry blossoms of his native land, he does
so through the smoke of the opium-pipe.</p>
<p>Then, how about our boasted white civilization which is
supposed to be superior to all? Some, of course, like to see
Yankee Doodle marching down the street, others draw the
hypodermic from its case to stimulate the vision of desire&mdash;or
sniff cocaine through the nostrils for the same purpose.</p>
<p>How much, I ask, has present-day civilization to offer the
Indian? Kind readers and hard-shelled scientists, I pray you,
let us be rational and let us go deeper into the field of investigation.
And I advise you for your own good to do so
even if <i>Datura meteloides</i> has failed to make its appearance
in the pharmacopoeia with its commercial mark [*Rx] prefixed
with the &ldquo;M.D.&rdquo; As I have said once before, there is very little
in the drugstores today for which the Indian cannot find
a substitute in the great field of nature. The plants I am
writing about in this book represent just one-fourth of the
medicinal botany of our Indians of the Pacific Southwest.</p>
<p>In support of my assertion, I only ask that you visit the
Historical Southwest Museum in Los Angeles, Calif., and see
with your own eyes what a medicine case consisted of for the
general practice of medicine in the early days, in those days
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
when most people of the white race thought themselves
further advanced in medicine than the Indians. Such was
not the case by far, and for a comparison and evidence of
my assertion I submit a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the contents used by the
first white doctor to practice medicine in the State of California.
His name I omit. His soul is at rest!</p>
<p>His medicine case contained a few vials: (1) Oil of Cloves,
(2) Spirits of Ammonia, (3) Spirits of Peppermint, (4) Wintergreen,
(5) Jamaica Ginger, (6) Castor Oil, (7) Quinine.</p>
<p>And that was all he had to serve as a comparison with
what the Indians used, and in this I prefer that you, kind
reader, be the judge. I am not exaggerating but speak only
in the light of truth. A great deal of misinterpretation of
Indian life has been written by white authors who gathered
their information from Indians who knew a great deal
but were unable to give comprehensive data to the white
writer. Others were there who could have done so, but their
lips were sealed where the white man was concerned. This
accounts for the mistakes which have been made and whereby
<i>Datura meteloides</i> has failed to gain recognition for its
meritorious medicinal value. It is worth knowing that the
plant is antivenin and will effect cures of rattlesnake and
tarantula bites. What improvement has the hard-shelled scientist
made to counteract the deadly poison of the tarantula?
None, of course!</p>
<p>Not so long ago a man in New Orleans, La., gave up his
life for want of a serum that would counteract the poison
of a tarantula which had bitten him. Three doctors, equipped
with all the white man&rsquo;s knowledge of medicine and chemistry,
strove desperately hard to save the man&rsquo;s life but finally
gave up in despair and frankly admitted that to date no
serum had been discovered to conquer the poison of the
tarantula!</p>
<p>Yet there is one and it behooves the medical profession to
get acquainted with <i>Datura meteloides</i>.</p>
<p>A practical and effective demonstration was given in the
presence of a group of mission friars at San Gabriel, California,
in the year 1828. The friars, having heard that <i>toulache</i>
was used by the Indians to cure rattlesnake bites, lost
no time in watching attentively the procedure followed by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
Indian in charge&mdash;Genio Guana-pia-pa was the medicine
man. The patient was seated before them well-covered with
a blanket, with only an opening remaining around the neck
in order to permit <i>Datura meteloides</i> to be poured over his
body. All this, of course, was very simple. But what of the
process used to extract the poison, when, and what compounds?
Yes, there is just one other which belongs in the
formula, a formula which has cost me thirty-two years of
waiting to finally wrest it from my uncle, Chief Pablo of Pe-we-pe
and Guana-pia-pa who gave me access to the ancient
historical records of the Indians of California, records which
many historians, archaeologists, and practically all men of
science would welcome.</p>
<p>The white man has missed the true and better half of the
Indian history of the Pacific Southwest. This I shall describe
in another book after the translation has been made.</p>
<p>The rattlesnake and tarantula formula I will donate to the
good of mankind, free under patent rights under my control
to avoid medical exploitation, speculation, and selfish
rights of monopoly. I am not in search of mere money. Honor
and character are of far more value to me. My happiness
comes to me from the good I can do to others, and this to
me is almost an obligation to clear and right every wrong
done to my people; not with a deadly weapon, but with pen
and ink, the Lord willing!</p>
<p>We Indians have not yet learned some of the ways and
customs of our white brothers, and, therefore, I could not
say that what cannot be done today can be done ten years
from now. Our religion and philosophy teach us that the heart
is the pendulum of life, each stroke representing timely
death which may befall us with one of these strokes any moment,
and so don&rsquo;t forget <i>Datura meteloides</i>.</p>
<p>Once an incident occurred when <i>Datura meteloides</i> was
being prepared at a place where the spying eyes of the friars
couldn&rsquo;t observe it. Enough plundering had been done already,
and the Indians had no desire to divulge their secret.
They would only show them what they could do. One of
the friars, full of doubt and curiosity, asked one of the Indians
who, the day before, had assisted a patient bitten by
a rattlesnake to go with him into one of the fields north of
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
the Mission, pretending he wanted information as to certain
plants growing there. When there, the friar drew near
to a <i>Datura meteloides</i>, and at once began questioning the
Indian about the plant, whereupon the Indian refused to
give information. The friar, seeing he couldn&rsquo;t make him
yield, began kicking at the plant, uttering at the same time
Latin words, which of course were wholly unintelligible to
the Indian. The friar did that only to make the Indian show
resentment, thinking he had cursed a plant which, to the
Indian, was sacred.</p>
<p>However, the friar&rsquo;s scheme didn&rsquo;t work; the Indian stood
by in silence, until at last the saintly friar lost control of
his temper, damned the Indian and his herbs and finally
told him that if he&rsquo;d dig up one of the roots he would
chew it, nay, even swallow it, just to show him it was worthless.</p>
<p>The Indian took him at his word, dug up a root and
handed it to him. Our friar was game and began chewing
it. Accidentally he swallowed some of the bitter juice and
in 15 minutes went through terrible convulsions, till death
came.</p>
<h3>Weather observation, travel and fishing aids, aqueous plants.</h3>
<h4>ECHINOCACTUS and SEMPERVIVUM
<br />(<i>Ind. Co-pash</i>)</h4>
<p>American Water-Barrel Cactus. An inhabitant of the arid
Pacific southwestern deserts. Like all Indians in their boyhood
days I was also warned of the great perils threatening
human beings in the desert, and in order to meet any
emergency which might arise, we received much instruction
for the time to come when this was absolutely necessary for
our safety. The schooling given us consisted chiefly of weather
observation, how to detect the approach of severe desert
storms from the very beginning of sunset through part of
the night by watching the action of the stars, the night atmosphere
and the various changes of the air currents.</p>
<p>All this had to be mastered to such a degree of perfection
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
that I doubt very much if any Bureau of Meteorology could
do better. Most of the changes indicated heat waves, electric
rainstorms, terrific wind, sand storms, etc. The only
instrument the Indian had was his index finger which he
made use of by holding it in his mouth for a few seconds,
then pulling it out quickly and thrusting it upright toward
the sky, his eyes fixed on the North Star. The side of the finger
which cooled quickest indicated the direction of the
wind.</p>
<p>Now came our water compasses, very primitive in form,
but instructive and true to sense of direction as direct leaders
to water holes.</p>
<p>Of course the Indians venturing across the arid desert were
always careful to take with them the <i>Sempervivum</i>&mdash;House
Leek&mdash;and, as an extra measure of precaution, another plant
which grows abundantly in the semi-arid regions. These very
same things were taught some of the old white pioneers who
were friendly and had shown kindness to the Indians, while
others perished from lack of knowledge of how to make use
of these plants&mdash;the <i>Echinocactus</i> and the <i>Sempervivum</i>,
which furnish thirst-quenching juices.</p>
<p>The thorns of the <i>Echinocactus</i> were used by the Indians
as fishhooks for deep-water fishing so that the modern fishhook
is by no means the white man&rsquo;s invention.</p>
<p>Both the <i>Echinocactus</i> and <i>Sempervivum</i> were also used
for the prevention of swelling of the salivary glands as a result
of the tongue being dry and inactive.</p>
<h3>General medication.</h3>
<h4>TRICHOSTEMA LANATUM
<br />(<i>Ind. Zu-bal</i>)</h4>
<p>American Wild Rosemary. This shrub, when in full bloom
in the months of May to July, emits a sweet, balsamic fragrance,
and is of great medicinal value for many ailments.</p>
<p>The Indians who made use of this plant a great deal had
no difficulty in tracing it through its scent to its place of
growth, where the flowering stocks were carefully gathered
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
so that the root and crown system suffered no injury. Extra
precaution was taken for the next annual blooming season,
for most of the plants were of a delicate nature. As far back
as I can remember, in the late &rsquo;90s, the <i>Trichostema lanatum</i>
grew in abundance along the near coastal ranges, but gradually
this very valuable plant became a victim of extermination
through brush fires at the hands of careless hunters and
the clearing of land by farmers. The Indians, perceiving how
rapidly these plants were vanishing, gathered the seeds and
carried them further inland, into rough mountain country
where they were resown, and there they remained in their
last botanical refuge with hundreds of others which are of
great medicinal value also.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from such localities Indian hunters would
gather the seeds and carry them still further into the mountains
for safety and for purposes of propagation. Today it is
solely due to the Indian&rsquo;s foresight that <i>Trichostema lanatum</i>
is found plentifully in the Pe-we-pe mountains, better known
today as the San Gorgania mountains. It is also found in
Riverside County and the San Jacinto mountains, on southward
over high mountaintops in lower California, Mexico,
and northward to San Rafael but rarely beyond that point.</p>
<h3>Ptomaine poisoning.</h3>
<h4>ERIOGONUM UMBELLATUM
<br />(<i>Ind. Hula-cal</i>)</h4>
<p>An inhabitant of the arid California desert, it is a massive,
white-flowering shrub remarkable for the long duration of
its blooming period which lasts from early June till late
September. During this time the desert may be seen covered
with a vast mass of white blossoms comparable in its color
effect to the winter snowfields in northern latitudes.</p>
<p>To have the opportunity to see the manifold flowering
wonders of this great desert, in their sudden magical changes,
one must visit it during the period from early February till
late in the fall.</p>
<p>The time to see cactus in bloom is in February and March.
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
The latter month ends the flowering season for this particular
plant. Again the desert becomes flowerless and gloomy
for at least two months and then good Mother Nature with
her magic wand once more transforms the desolate desert
into a brilliant garden of flowers and shrubs. There are the
Yucca Whipplei and the yucca palm, the Joshua palm and the
desert lilac, the desert poinsettias, marguerites, desert and
scrub pines. All a riot of color, but the <i>Eriogonum</i> survives
them all into September. What a wonderful array of color
greets the eye! As far as it can see it is fairly stunned by
these glowing tints and hues, from rich ultramarine to pale
yellow&mdash;red, lavender, purple, pink, light blue, to the purest
cream white. This blooming season ends in July, but alone
the <i>Eriogonum</i> keeps on blooming till September.</p>
<p>Then there is one short rest period for about one month
as if in preparation for a carpet of golden blooms.</p>
<p>Shrubs, bushes, and small trees which have been practically
dormant for ten months of the year burst out in golden vestments
to greet the approaching winter, and bid a last farewell
to Indian Summer.</p>
<p>Such is the aspect of the desert, at that time of the year.
And, strangest of all, of all the hundreds of species of trees,
bushes, and shrubs, all different from each other, not one
bears anything but yellow blossoms.</p>
<p>Let us turn back to where we began, to the especial value
of the plant to hunters and vacationists who make their yearly
visits to certain mountain and desert regions favored by them.
It will certainly do no harm to acquaint yourself with the
medicinal value of the <i>Eriogonum</i> since you have to depend
for your sustenance mostly on canned foods.</p>
<p>Occasions arise when users of such foods are made very ill,
even suffer death, through so-called ptomaine poisoning. To
obtain the service of a doctor is well-nigh an impossibility
and ptomaine poisoning is a fast-working, exceedingly dangerous
poison, where delay is fatal.</p>
<p>The plant <i>Eriogonum</i> grows nowadays in the coastal regions
as well as in the desert where it originally came from,
and the first thing to do when attacked by ptomaine poison
is to make a strong infusion from the blossoms of the <i>Eriogonum</i>,
or, if these are not available, use the roots, and take,
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
or give to the poison victim, two brimful cups with a pinch
of salt added to each cup.</p>
<p>This remedy counteracts the poison and gives safe and
complete relief.</p>
<h3>Jewelry and talismans.</h3>
<h4>ASCLEPIAS SYRIACA
<br />(<i>Ind. Samat-hap-pac</i>)</h4>
<p>American Milk Weed. White botanists claim this plant to
be edible, but to my knowledge there is no botanical record
extant which bears out the assertion as to its ever having
been used as a food.</p>
<p>The Indians pressed out the milky juices and used the
extract obtained in the manufacture of their jewelry, most
of their precious stones being made into necklaces, earrings,
collars, wrist and upper arm bracelets, all mounted in this
milk-juice preparation of the <i>Asclepias syriaca</i>.</p>
<p>This kind of jewelry was worn by Indians of a higher civilization
as talismans, just as civilized people of today wear
similar ornamental articles with more or less superstitious
belief. We need only point to the so-called &ldquo;charms&rdquo; worn
by many to bring luck, ward off disaster or sickness&mdash;in fact,
for more reasons of a superstitious nature than the Indian
ever thought of.</p>
<p>A great deal in the way of royalties are due the Indian,
in return for the use of his art-craft, yet a few jewelry items
have been overlooked by Mr. Jeweler&mdash;items which, peradventure,
may bring him great wealth if properly ballyhooed.</p>
<p>Let us take, for instance, the case of the witch-doctor among
the Indians with his special ornamental necklace&mdash;the symbol
of his profession&mdash;a necklace denoting supernatural powers,
a crystal quartz for a nose-piece. The necklace is made of
eagle-, bear- and lion-claws, the poison fangs of rattlesnakes,
etc.</p>
<p>It must be understood, however, that the necklace mentioned
will not endow the wearer of it with any power whatsoever,
unless those various claws are extracted from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
living animals which, no doubt, makes the manufacture of
such a necklace somewhat hazardous and dangerous.</p>
<p>As far as is known, no patent has been granted yet on
the process of getting these necklace ornaments in compliance
with the rules of &ldquo;Charm-Craft.&rdquo; So here is a fine chance
for some enterprising, courageous jeweler to strive for renown
and riches.</p>
<p>But, Mr. Jeweler, there must be no copying, no pilfering
of any sort. The rules must be obeyed in strict honesty.
The patent will then be found waiting.</p>
<h3>Hunting with poisoned arrows.</h3>
<h4>KALMIA LATIFOLIA
<br />(<i>Ind. Po-ha-not</i>)</h4>
<p>American California Mountain Laurel. It may be of interest
to sportsmen that this plant, growing in the high mountain
ranges, is as greatly relished by the deer as <i>Hosackia
glabra</i>. Deer in large numbers look for this shrubby tree
and this is the key to the white man&rsquo;s puzzle why Indians
are such successful hunters. It is simply that the Indian lived
the life God intended him to, and, through close association
with animals in the wilderness, he became proficient in observing
their habits, imitating their calls and thus bringing
them within shooting distance of his bow and arrow. Here
the <i>Kalmia</i> played an important part. The hunter not only
used it as a body deodorizer, but also made use of the top
part of a deer skull with the skin and antlers left on, never
exposing more than these, when lying in ambush.</p>
<p>The <i>Kalmia</i> had other virtues, besides, in that it furnished
one of the ingredients to compound a poison in which to
dip arrowheads. A deer hit with an arrow had a slim chance
of getting away wounded. If it happened, it was only for
a short distance and then it would drop paralyzed from the
effect of the poisoned arrow. The meat was edible and harmless
and none was left over.</p>
<p>The grizzly bear was one of the most ferocious members
of the bear family in the Pacific Southwest. Although quite
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
common and plentiful, this powerful animal was killed with
as much ease as the housewife of today kills a chicken.</p>
<p>When hunting this bear the Indians would select one which
had the best coat of hair. Two Indians would work together,
beginning with yelling, singing, and dancing around him to
such effect that he became very angry and charged one of the
hunters. With speed and precision the other one would run
up to the bear from behind and shoot his arrow straight into
the bear&rsquo;s kidneys, thus in most cases rendering the bear
quite helpless; and try as hard as he might to turn on his
enemy, his efforts proved futile. Paralyzed in the hind legs
due to the arrow being imbedded in the kidneys handicapped
him so that he had to vent his rage in a sitting position.
The other Indian in front of him, thereupon would
shoot an arrow straight into his ear, ending it all in a few
seconds. The skin, when cured and tanned, was used for the
interior lining of tepees, bed covers, and ground mattresses.
However, the time came when bear hunting was abolished
by executive orders of our Indian chieftains, and this was
caused by the following:</p>
<p>At one time these Indian chiefs, while traversing their territory,
were attracted by gunfire. Driven by suspicion and
curiosity, they decided to investigate and went to where the
shooting was taking place. Great, indeed, was their surprise
when they came upon two white hunters battling with a
grizzly and it seemed that the bullets of the old-time muzzle-loading
gun didn&rsquo;t prove up to expectations. There was
very little time to reload, so one of the hunters threw his
gun away and fled with the other partner in close pursuit,
the wounded bear right on their heels and in full command
of the situation.</p>
<p>The sight of this caused the chiefs great mirth and fun,
and from that day forth, it was made known to all the tribes
that the bear had some human understanding, had no use
for the white man and was the protector of the Indians&rsquo;
domain. The act witnessed by the chiefs that day made the
bear a regular member and scout of honor of all tribes facing
a possible invasion of their virgin country.</p>
<p>In spite of all this, however, the white man resorted to
the use of traps and poisoned bait to exterminate the Indians&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
friend. But, advised by some intelligent instinct this
animal had, the bear decided suddenly to leave, and drifted
away into Mexico and to northern latitudes.</p>
<p>Even to this day, the bear is considered a great friend
by the Indians and when one is killed or dies of natural
causes, much reverence and respect is paid him by the older
people who, in their minds, are still living in earlier days,
now gone by.</p>
<h3>Care of the eyes.</h3>
<h4>SALVIA COLUMBRIAE
<br />(<i>Ind. Pa-sal</i>)</h4>
<p>This plant belongs to the food division but plays another
important r&ocirc;le, considering what it means to a person to be
relieved of the excruciating pain caused by the introduction
of a foreign substance into the eye, thus producing a temporary
obstruction of the vision. Many Indians, after a hard
day&rsquo;s hunting or riding through severe sandstorms, had this
experience, and consequently, they never neglected to give
their eyes proper care.</p>
<p>When time to retire, the Indian would put at least a couple
of seeds of the <i>Salvia columbriae</i> under the eyelids, and, with
eyes shut tight to keep the seed from dropping out, he
would fall asleep. As they swelled, they would move about
with every movement of the eyeball and emit a gelatinous
substance which gathered up every particle of sand or any
other substance present, and, when removed, left the eye clear
and free of any possible inflammation. This is a good example
of the care the Indian gave his eyes and accounts for
his good and strong vision.</p>
<p>An inhabitant of the arid lands, it grows prolifically in
places where in earlier days the Indians made their homes,
and very often the ancient dwellings which our people used
will be found covered with large beds of <i>Salvia columbriae</i>,
with their beautiful blossoms of purple and lavender.</p>
<p>These colors were to the Indians a mournful reminder
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
of their departed ones, in their lifelong struggle and search
for food, so mightily important to sustain life. Regarding
the use of the <i>Columbriae</i> for this purpose, the method used
was very simple.</p>
<p>It was cut and bundled by the male members of the family,
brought in and heaped up on a large cleared space of
ground, formed into a circle and then trodden down as hard
as a cement floor. This was done with water and the bare
feet and threshing with long sticks. By thus beating the heap
of <i>Columbriae</i>, they released the seeds which were then
winnowed by being blown before a wind current made with
the aid of two baskets. After this, they were carried to the
grinding stones to be ground into a fine meal which made
excellent porridge&mdash;a very popular dish among Indians.</p>
<h3>Foods, medicine, tanning and dyes.</h3>
<h4>QUERCUS VIRGINIANA
<br />(<i>Ind. Qui-neel</i>)</h4>
<p>American Live Oak. This evergreen tree of the western
mountain ranges is the most imposing of all the species of
the oak family. It grows to an immense size and attains a
great height. Some of these giants of the forest cover and
shade an area large enough to afford protection to as many
as three hundred adult persons.</p>
<p>A great deal has been written in song and poetry in praise
of the stately oak but the Indians found out by experience
that the acorns it bore were far more nutritious than poetry,
and before long the noble tree was adopted as a regular
member of the tribes&mdash;a bountiful provider of food.</p>
<p>Even so, the oak was by them much honored in war and
love songs, for the many good things it furnished them besides
food. The fallen leaves made warm mattress-bedding
while the bark played a part in medicine and also in the
tanning and dyeing of buckskin in various fast colors by
blending with the bark of other oaks and roots. Let it be understood
that these dyes thus produced were of a firm, non-fading
nature and also excellent preservers of buckskin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>The colors produced were very beautiful and ranged from
pure white to yellow, red, light and dark brown, light pink,
gray and black.</p>
<p>Regarding the acorns, special care was given to the harvested
crop and the process was simple. The acorns were put
into fine, hand-woven net bags and tied with a rawhide rope
to a tree close to the river bank whereupon the bags were
placed in the stream. The running water would cause the
acorn shell to swell and split open, thus releasing into the
water most of the tannic acid which the acorns contained.
After being left in the water for a week or so, they were
taken out, the hulls removed and spread out to dry. Afterwards
they were ground into a fine meal, sun-dried again,
and then put away for winter use.</p>
<p>The porridge made of it jells like custard and, when well
cooked, has the color of chocolate pie. It can be cut into
squares and served with deer meat or eaten as a dessert with
cream and sugar. Besides being very delicious and nourishing
it is also a great flesh builder.</p>
<p>As a warning, let it be said, never to eat any acorns picked
fresh from the tree, because of the tannic acid they contain;
in that state they may cause severe constriction of the bowels
and the glands of the throat.</p>
<h3>Bleeding navel.</h3>
<h4>TYPHA LATIFOLIA and QUERCUS AGRIFOLIA
<br />(<i>Ind. Co-o-tem</i>)<span class="hst"> (<i>Ind. Qui-neel</i>)</span></h4>
<p>American Cat-tail is an aquatic grass inhabiting shallow,
stagnant lakes and swamps and is very common on the Pacific
coast of California. <i>Tule</i> is perhaps the name by which the
plant is best known, although the other is also very common.
This valuable grass has failed to find a place among the scientists
of the world, as <i>Tule</i> is a purely Indian name, and is far
from being identical with those so far being classified by
botanical science. But <i>Tule</i> is medicinal and has healing
properties which were made use of by the Indians to heal
bleeding navels. Nothing could be better.</p>
<p>The blades of the grass were gathered and burned to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
consistency of charcoal, then finely powdered and sprinkled
on the bleeding parts.</p>
<p>When this couldn&rsquo;t be obtained, the Indians further inland
had recourse to the apples growing on the Scrub-Oak or
<i>Quercus agrifolia</i>, and these were, of course, dried and powdered,
and medicated with balsam oil. The salve proved to be
very effective in healing the afflicted parts. In short, the
results were first-class and saved the lives of many little
Indian babies.</p>
<h3>Indian food.</h3>
<h4>PROSOPIS JULIFLORA
<br />(<i>Ind. Pe-che-te</i>)</h4>
<p>Mesquite Bean. An inhabitant of the southwestern deserts,
it ranges as far as the northwestern and southwestern central
parts of Mexico. A native of southeastern California, Arizona,
New Mexico, and Texas, the <i>Juliflora</i> was perhaps
one of the trees which provided the greater part of food for
the natives.</p>
<p>Its contents were very rich in protein and even wild animals
relished it greatly. To obtain the yearly supply, the
Indians made a regular pilgrimage early in the season to
localities where the <i>Juliflora</i> grew in abundance, and stood
guard over the trees for many weeks until the bean pods
were fully matured. Then they were harvested and ground
in rock mortars to the fineness of flour, such as is used in the
baking of cakes, tarts, etc.</p>
<p>It could also be mixed to the consistency of porridge,
either with hot or cold water and taken with sun-dried venison.
It formed a very nourishing diet. Sugar was never added
to it.</p>
<p>The bean pods of the <i>Juliflora</i> are extremely sweet, and
may be eaten right off the tree if dry enough. In any other
condition they are unpalatable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<h4>PTERIS AQUILINA
<br />(<i>Ind. Wel-met</i>)</h4>
<p>American Bracken Fern. This graceful and stately fern of
great beauty of leaf design inhabits the high mountain
ranges where there are well-shaded forest lands rich in mulch.
This fern is well-known to every Indian for the sad historical
part it played in the life of our fair and beloved sister
Ramona, the daughter of Ca-we and wife of Alessandro, the
immortal Indian who suffered death without a moment&rsquo;s
warning at the hands of a brute and coward.</p>
<p>The authoress of <i>Ramona</i>, Helen Hunt Jackson, mentions
in her book what good use of this fern Alessandro made
in preparing Ramona&rsquo;s bed at the time of their elopement
and tells of the hardships both young lovers underwent.</p>
<p>The young sprouting shoots of the <i>Pteris aquilina</i> fern
mean as much to the Indians as asparagus does to white
people, as it contains much oil which is extremely rich in
flavor when the shoots are properly cut and cooked.</p>
<p>There are ferns in song, ferns in poetry, ferns where wedding
bells ring, ferns on the altars of churches and ferns
in God&rsquo;s acre. Also in gardens, but nature&rsquo;s garden is where
the Indian wants them!</p>
<h3>Food and bleaching.</h3>
<h4>YUCCA WHIPPLEI
<br />(<i>Ind. Yu-ca</i>)</h4>
<p>American Spanish Bayonet. The name yucca is the true
native Indian name of this exquisite plant, but even Mr.
Whipple, the botanist, failed, like many others, to properly
describe the beauty of the yucca.</p>
<p>During the months of May and June when the plant is
in full bloom it is nothing strange, when venturing into the
desert mountains, to find oneself in a veritable forest of
countless thousands of yuccas. With its erect stalk, attaining
a height of from four to twelve feet, heavily and massively
crowned with creamy white blossoms, the yucca closely resembles
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
a gigantic hyacinth of the California desert and mountains,
and its delicious fragrance outrivals many of the costliest
perfumes.</p>
<p>The use of the yucca was of much importance, some of
the stalks were cut just at the time the plant was in full
bloom, the flowers are edible, the stalk rich in sugar which
produces a fine quality of syrup, obtained by first roasting the
stalks in underground pits.</p>
<p>Other stalks were allowed to mature, their pods yielding
the finest material for bleaching buckskin fiber a pure white.
Also used very much in the art of basketry, etc.</p>
<h3>Rheumatism.</h3>
<h4>URTICA HOLOSERICEA
<br />(<i>Ind. Panga-tum</i>)</h4>
<p>American Stinging Nettle. An inhabitant of the swamps
and river beds. This plant was used in most cases of inflammatory
rheumatism of the most peculiar kind known to mankind,
particularly when the lower limbs were affected to
such an extent that they became numb, cold and useless.
The cure was very simple if your limbs were in a bad state,
but rather unpleasant if in a sound condition.</p>
<p>The nettle was cut and brought to the Indian patient&rsquo;s
bedside, where the leaves were rubbed on all his ailing parts.
This was repeated for several days until warmth in the affected
parts and a proper circulation of the blood was attained.
When the patient was able to get up and walk, a
second treatment of a different nature was administered, the
so-called Rock Steam-Bath of a herb compound made up of
the following three plants:</p>
<h4>PHLOX SUBULATA
<br />(<i>Ind. E-wa-yack</i>)</h4>
<p>American Moss Pink. An inhabitant of the Mojave Desert.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<h4>PINUS MONTICOLA
<br />(<i>Ind. Wa-ta</i>)</h4>
<p>American Scrub Pine. An inhabitant of the northern slopes
of our California Mother coast range, and in a few localities
on the desert floor.</p>
<h4>ADIANTUM CAPILLUS-VENERIS
<br />(<i>Ind. Ta-wal</i>)</h4>
<p>American Southern Maidenhair Fern. Inhabits the high
coastal ranges, but further north it will be found on the
lower coastal ranges.</p>
<h3>Menstrual period.</h3>
<h4>LIPPIA LANCEOLATA
<br />(<i>Ind. Te-eel-p-yack</i>)</h4>
<p>Lemon Verbena. Spanish <i>Cedron</i>. This shrubby tree has
become nearly extinct and but few specimens are found now
and then. The infusion made from its leaves and blossoms
is very aromatic, somewhat like peppermint.</p>
<h4>CRYSANTHEMUM PARTHENIUM
<br />(<i>Ind. Che-ke-wat</i>)</h4>
<p>American Feverfew, Spanish <i>Artemisa</i>. This plant was
used for the same medicinal purpose as the one mentioned
above.</p>
<h3>Diseased throat glands, scrofula.</h3>
<h4>NICOTIANA GLAUCA
<br />(<i>Ind. Tee-baat</i>)</h4>
<p>American Tobacco Tree. This tree, very common along
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
the Pacific coast, grows from Santa Barbara southward to the
end of Lower California, and the Mexican peninsula. The
tree grows in terraced gorges and ravines and is rarely to be
found anywhere else.</p>
<p>The leaves were steamed and applied externally as a poultice
over the swollen parts of the throat caused by inflammation
of the throat glands, and also for scrofula. While the
latter malady didn&rsquo;t exist among the Indians, yet they treated
and cured some of the whites who had it, with <i>Nicotiana
glauca</i>.</p>
<p>It was also steamed into the body of those suffering from
rheumatism and proved there also its value to many human
beings.</p>
<p>I have once before spoken of other plants useful for the
same purpose, but as this plant has something to recommend
it for the last-named ailment, it is appropriate to mention
it again in connection with scrofula and inflammation of
the throat glands.</p>
<p>To the plant serving all these cases equally well, we must
give credit where credit is due, even at the cost of repetition,
in order to give the reader a fair understanding of the various
diseases a plant may be good for.</p>
<p>Surely a wonderful provision made by nature!</p>
<h3>Fishing.</h3>
<h4>CROTON SETIGERUS
<br />(<i>Ind. Tu-tal</i>)</h4>
<p>American Dove Weed. The beautiful dwarf plant is very
common throughout the coastal region and far into the inland
valleys. It appears about July in most barley fields after
the harvest. It is truly a paradise for wild turtledoves, and
the hunter who goes into a place where the <i>Croton setigerus</i>
grows may be sure of bagging a good number of doves in a
short time.</p>
<p>The Indians gathered the plant for use in their fishing
operations, and some of it was stored away for winter use.
The weed has a strongly intoxicating effect on fish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>A place was selected along the stream bed in a rather shallow
spot and dammed across.</p>
<p>After this, a regular mat, formed of <i>Setigerus</i>, was laid on
the surface of the water, while a large number of Indians
went upstream to herd the schools of fish downstream and
into the trap. Quite a simple procedure, as the herding was
done by merely beating the water ahead of them. A barricade
built of brushwood behind them prevented the fish from
going upstream. The water in the pond having become impregnated
with the <i>Setigerus</i> affected the fish so that they
soon floated helplessly on the surface of the water where the
Indians just picked them out by hand. When a sufficient supply
had been taken, the <i>Croton setigerus</i> was removed and
piled up on the bank of the stream to dry and be used again.
The dam and barricade were also done away with and the
uncaught fish were allowed to get into fresh water to recuperate.</p>
<h3>Tonic for loss of appetite.</h3>
<h4>MONTIA PERFOLIATA
<br />(<i>Ind. Lah-chu-meek</i>)</h4>
<p>American Miner&rsquo;s Lettuce. This plant inhabits the coastal
regions where it thrives only in deep, decomposed beds of
oak-tree mulch at suitable points in the shady woodlands,
where the circulation of water is present under a deposit of
mulch.</p>
<p>The juice of the plant is an excellent appetite-restorer.</p>
<h4>ALLIUM BISCEPTRUM
<br />(<i>Ind. Ye-sil-ta-usa</i>)</h4>
<p>American Wild Onion. It is an inhabitant of the lower
mid-coast ranges, and the extract obtained from it is compounded
with the powdered berries of <i>Rhus trilobata</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h4>RHUS TRILOBATA
<br />(<i>Ind. Sa-lat</i>)</h4>
<p>American Squaw-weed. An inhabitant of Southern California&rsquo;s
higher ranges, it makes an excellent restorative for an
inactive stomach which refuses food. The Indians also obtained
the fiber from the vines of the shrub by stripping it
off with the thumbnail and using it for basket making.</p>
<h3>For poisonous insect-bites.</h3>
<h4>ALLIUM CANADENSE or ALLIUM VINEALE
<br />(<i>Ind. Ye-sil-we-na</i>)</h4>
<p>American Wild Field Garlic. A plant held in great esteem
by the Indians, protecting them, when hunting or exploring,
from poisonous snakes, lizards, scorpions, tarantulas and insects
during the summer season.</p>
<p>It was the custom of the Indians then to discard their
buckskin clothes and roam around with as little covering as
possible until the fall of the year, when they donned their
heavier clothing again for the approaching cold weather.
Now, it is well-known how disagreeable the odor of garlic
is to most human beings, but they don&rsquo;t know that it is
likewise so to reptiles and insects. The Indians, however,
knew this, although they never ate it. They used it only as
medicine when needed, but its greatest usefulness was to
guard against being bitten by poisonous vermin.</p>
<p>The Indians ground the wild garlic into a pulp and then
rubbed it well over their legs up to the thighs, making extra
sure that the skin was thoroughly saturated with the garlic
juice and thus protected. The Indian would enter any locality
to do his hunting, even if it was infested with thousands
of rattlesnakes, without the slightest fear or worry.
The reason is very simple. Whenever the snake or insect
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
comes within smelling distance of the garlic, it is so much
affected by it as to become well-nigh asphyxiated and is rendered
helpless.</p>
<p>The white man, in order to follow fashion, wears leggings,
but I am sure that he could use the formula I have given,
very much to his advantage. I give this formula freely to
mankind, a formula which has remained a secret for over a
century and it will mean the saving of many lives if used
as described above.</p>
<h3>Antidote.</h3>
<h4>BERTHOLLETIA
<br />(<i>Ind. Pacah-quit</i>)</h4>
<p>American Arrow-wood. It is an inhabitant of the California
River border lands within the Pacific coastal belt, and is occasionally
also found on the southern border of the western
desert lying in the northern part of the Pacific coast.</p>
<p>There has been much discussion in the past, and many
arguments, many flatly declaring that the arrowwood was
used by the Indians for making bows and arrow stocks.</p>
<p>Being an Indian, that and nothing else, let me explain
the matter clearly as to this particular controversy. The
young shoots of the <i>Bertholletia</i> were selected from the parent
stock, well-seasoned and then used for arrow stocks on
which small arrow points were fitted for the young Indian
children to practice and hunt with. It was never used for
bows, however. For the making of fire through friction, it
was very useful and yet, this alone would not give an adequate
account of the value of arrowwood shrub. This is left
to the decoction made from it, to counteract the poison in
wounds inflicted by arrowheads in battle engagements, and
therein lies its principal claim to the consideration shown
it by the Indians.</p>

<h3>Sedative.</h3>
<h4>PHYTOLACCA DECANDRA
<br />(<i>Ind. Che-ne-va-ica-cal</i>)</h4>
<p>American Ink Berry. This shrub, a common inhabitant of
California&rsquo;s coastal regions, has been placed by the white
writer in the division of poisonous plants, and we agree with
him. So the only credit given the plant is chiefly for the remarkable
beauty it displays with its starlike flowers and
racemes of dark-blue berries. Yet it has been condemned
under the label of poison, and much is being done toward
its destruction wherever found. However, it is a fruitless
task, and may only become a near-success when the Indians
and the birds shall be known as two signs of life vanished
from the face of the earth. For these two are responsible for
the preservation and propagation of the shrub.</p>
<p>Morphine, opium, and cocaine are by far deadlier poisons
than <i>Phytolacca</i>&mdash;why, then, do doctors prescribe them to
soothe and ease pain, etc.? The root of the plant has some
medicinal qualities to ease severe neuralgic pains, and is
deemed very efficient and important in Indian medical formulas.
For making dyes and inks the berries are excellent,
whereas the leaves are most useful in the treatment of skin
diseases, and to eradicate and clean the epidermis of pimples
and blackheads.</p>
<p>Therefore, help to conserve and not destroy this really
valuable plant.</p>
<h3>Diseases of the liver.</h3>
<h4>RORIPPA NASTURTIUM OFFICINALE
<br />(<i>Ind. Pang-sa-mat</i>)</h4>
<p>American Water Cress. It is an inhabitant of the coastal
regions, swamps and rivers. This aquatic plant is more deserving
of attention than has been given it, and is fully
worthy of the name it bears, <i>Officinale</i>, which means all that
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
the word implies. The Indians, having discovered the medicinal
qualities of this plant, immediately gave it a place in their
medical and food division and, up to the present year of
our Lord, the plant has been used in the treatment of disorders
of the liver&mdash;cases such as torpid liver, cirrhosis of the
liver and as a dissolvent of gallstones, etc.</p>
<p>When these diseases are curable, the diet is simple&mdash;with
no restrictions and no red tape to plague the patient. The
first meal taken in the morning must consist of <i>Nasturtium
officinale</i>, salted very sparingly, and of this the patient
should eat as much as possible and do without further food
until noon, when he may eat whatever he likes. This method
must be repeated every morning. Care must be taken not to
use liquor if one wishes to insure quick recovery.</p>
<p>When the liver is ulcerated it takes at least two months to
heal properly, but all other cases are of short duration.</p>
<h3>Reducing teas.</h3>
<h4>LEPIDIUM EPETALUM
<br />(<i>Ind. Chesa-mok-ka-mok</i>)</h4>
<p>American Pepper Grass.</p>
<h4>SALINIA
<br />(<i>Ind. Cheena-wah</i>)</h4>
<p>American Salt Grass.</p>
<h4>PANICUM CAPILLARE
<br />(<i>Ind. Ne-wa-cha-mo</i>)</h4>
<p>American Witch Grass. The first two are fond of rich, agricultural
soils, whereas the latter prefers alkaline lands. All
three have been declared noxious weeds and are listed as
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
such by the Department of Agriculture, although the Indians
found some use for these grasses.</p>
<p>There were times when some of our men and women became
over-fat; in fact, so fat that they had great difficulty in
traveling, the exertion making them complain of heart trouble
which in reality was nothing but a discomfort due
to short respiration caused by excessive fatness. Accordingly,
something had to be done. A search was made, and experiments
with good results finally obtained. These grasses compounded
with the bark of sassafras, wall-wort and others
(also named for extermination, just like the three above-named
plants) are excellent for reducing purposes.</p>
<p>The chief trouble in our schools where botany is taught
seems to be that too much attention is given to the <i>appearance</i>
of plants, instead of to their medicinal value and other
useful properties.</p>
<h3>Birth control.</h3>
<h4>IVA AXILLARIS
<br />(<i>Ind. Na-wish-mal</i>)</h4>
<p>American Poverty-Weed. This hardy plant predominates
on most of the salty marshes and lake shores. It is hardly
worth destroying as it mostly grows in soils totally unfit for
agriculture, or anything else, for that matter.</p>
<p>Let me mention, however, that there is quite a history
connected with the earliest beginning of the Indian&rsquo;s life
in connection with this plant. No doubt it will be of interest
to the readers of this book to learn that the plant played
an important part in what is today assumed to be a modern
institution&mdash;birth-control.</p>
<p>The Indians knew and practiced it from the earliest times,
but only in cases when women proved themselves incapable,
even when at their best, to give birth to healthy children.</p>
<p>In such cases they were compelled to make use of this plant
as a preventative and this should explain the Indian&rsquo;s wonderful
stamina, his sturdiness and perfect physique. Moreover,
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
the great chiefs prohibited the raising of deformed
children, as ordinarily they considered this a great sin.</p>
<p>In later years the secret was let out by some Indian women,
and thus it found its way among the Spanish and American
settlers, when many cases of abortion were due to the use of
this herb&mdash;a universal practice of modern civilization with
its accompanying evils of genocide and other evils of a criminal
nature.</p>
<h3>Kidney diseases.</h3>
<h4>CROTON CORYMBOSUS
<br />(<i>Ind. O-chot-pa-wish</i>)</h4>
<p>Spurge. Its habitat is in the southern Mojave sand dunes.
This beautiful shrub, like many of the other desert plants,
seems to select the worst of soils to grow in, and is often to
be found in crevices of mineralized dykes of crystalline rocks.
The infusion made from the plant cured kidney infections.</p>
<h4>EPHEDRA
<br />(<i>Ind. Tut-tut</i>)</h4>
<p>The Tea of the Indian is found in the swamplands of the
coastal regions. The infusion made from the leaves and blossoms
was taken internally for pleurisy of the kidneys.</p>
<p>An infusion made separately from the roots was also used
internally to relieve severe cases of gonorrhea and painful
bloating of the stomach. This remedy is very effective and
highly esteemed by the Indians as one of the royal plants
for the cure of these dangerous ailments, which take the
lives of so many of the white race.</p>
<h4>APIUM
<br />(<i>Ind. Se-ma-mek</i>)</h4>
<p>American Parsley. Its habitat is the swamps and coastal
regions. The infusion made from this plant was taken regularly
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
and in preference to water or any other beverage for
chronic diseases of the kidneys.</p>
<p>The tea is very rich in flavor and pleasant to the taste. The
patient should partake of as much as one half gallon per
day and also eat an equal amount of it. The plant having
been domesticated it is no trouble to get it anywhere. Even
butcher shops and vegetable dealers sell it.</p>
<h4>XANTHIUM CANADENSE
<br />(<i>Ind. Cho-co-late</i>)</h4>
<p>American Cocklebur. It grows everywhere in California,
being found in every swamp and pasture land&mdash;a veritable
nuisance to the cattle raiser.</p>
<p>From the medical standpoint, however, the plant is very
valuable to the members of both sexes who are suffering
from diseased kidneys complicated with gonorrhea, diseases
which, when allowed to take their own course, will in due
time develop into tuberculosis, rheumatism, and finally total
paralysis of both the upper and lower limbs, as has happened
in such cases.</p>
<p>The introduction of these maladies occurred with the advent
of the white race into our territory and this caused the
Indians to go into further botanical research to find the
proper plants to combat and conquer these dreadful diseases.
I introduce the world in general to two other sister
plants, and also three belonging to a different group.</p>
<h4>CENTAUREA MELITENSIS
<br />(<i>Ind. Se-sa-naa</i>)</h4>
<p>American Star Thistle.</p>
<h4>XANTHIUM SPINOSUM
<br />(<i>Ind. O-yu-mo-val</i>)</h4>
<p>American Spiny Cocklebur.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<h4>MALVACEA RUBRA
<br />(<i>Ind. E-ya-wa-manka</i>)</h4>
<p>American Creeping Rock Mallow. Spanish <i>Yerba Mora
Real</i>.</p>
<h3>Venereal diseases.</h3>
<h4>CERCOCARPUS BETULAEFOLIUS
<br />(<i>Ind. Man-geet</i>)</h4>
<p>American Mahogany Shrub. Its habitat is in the California
hills and mountains, and it is quite common. The
bark and roots were made into an infusion and taken by
the Indians for venereal diseases or gonorrhea gleet.</p>
<h4>CENTUNCULUS
<br />(<i>Ind. Pepe-nel</i>)</h4>
<p>American Pimpernel. Its habitat is on the northern slopes
of the highest mountain peaks of California, at an elevation
of from eight to ten thousand feet above sea level. This wonder
plant is made into a tea and taken in acute cases of
gonorrhea, where the bladder and urinal tract fail to function.</p>
<h4>EDIBLE FRUITS OF SHRUBS</h4>

mountains:</p>

<p>These berries should be eaten sparingly, as the acidity
contained in them is much stronger than that of citric acid.
Their chief use is to quench the thirst, where water is scarce
in the mountains, either when hunting or hiking, or engaged
in fighting forest fires. For this purpose the berries
above will be found excellent and a veritable boon. Everyone
traveling in desert or mountains should make himself
familiar with the plants and fruits growing therein, as this
knowledge not only permits him to guard against possible
discomfort or hardship, but has also been the means of saving
life. The Indians knew that better than anyone else.</p>
<p>No doubt, the following literary effort in the English language
by Chief Pablo will set the risibilities of my readers
to working. Als, the Chief, never had the benefit of a school
education, and English wasn&rsquo;t easy for him to acquire. However,
he was game, and in 1908, when he was appointed Chief
of the Indian Reservation, he bravely set to work and wrote
this article.</p>
<p>He was sixty-four years old then. Nothing would do but
he must have a typewriter. Right manfully he tackled it, but
when he had finished he heaved a tremendous sigh and declared
he&rsquo;d rather go on the warpath than pound a typewriter
again.</p>
<p>But he surely deserves great credit and his record as Chief
of the Indian Police was a brilliant one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">The Legend of Console Mineral Springs near Homuba Canyon</span></h2>
<p>The canyon has been known as Homuba among the Indians
for many years. And on that canyon there are three mineral
springs. They are located near Loma Linda. It is southeast
from Loma Linda, way up in the canyon, a distance of three
miles.</p>
<p>Professor J. Console, an Indian friend, is the owner of the
mineral springs nowadays. In the early days the Indians called
the springs <i>Phal-poole</i>, <i>Phal-quapekalet</i>, <i>Hickescah-heppasca</i>,
which means Witch Springs, Life Springs, Sisters and Brother
Springs.</p>
<p>Those three springs were discovered in this way. There
were Indian settlements all over that country, near the springs
and around the springs. One day three Indian children, two
sisters and one brother, went up the canyon and disappeared
in those springs. The father and mother and other relatives
of the missing children followed the tracks of the children
until they came to the springs. After having tried everything
to find them, the father and mother and the relatives in their
sorrow went to the witch-doctors to see if they could help
them find the children. Then one witch-doctor said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me and I will show you where your children
are and how they disappeared in those springs. You may not
see them but you will hear them, and you will have to be
satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the children&rsquo;s family went there and the witch-doctor
stopped at the center spring and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to the Great Father who is above us, the Creator
of the world. He has taken your boy and put him in this
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
spring, so that this spring will bring health to you and to
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the witch-doctor walked up to the spring and spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother, your father and mother and all the relatives are
here, and they would like to hear from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a voice arose from the spring and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here with my two sisters. We were placed here by
our Lord, the Creator of the world. He has given me the
power to bring new life to those who are sick. You may
come and visit me and my sisters whenever you wish. My
elder sister is in the spring on the east side of me, and my
younger sister in the spring on the west side of me. But we
are all three in this one place, and if you will live together
and honor the great Lord, when you are sick if you will use
these life springs, we will help you get back your health.
These springs shall be known as the &lsquo;Two Sisters and Brother
Life Springs.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And all the people listened. Therefore the Indians went
up there and held a great ceremony, and from then on they
used the springs for medical purposes.</p>
<p>Then the Catholic missionaries came to this country and
established the missions. They took the Indian children by
force and made them Catholics. And these Christians also
went up to the springs and used them for many years.</p>
<p>Later on the United States Government came to this country
and took these lands and gave the Indians reservations
for their use. And the Indians had to leave the springs, which
originally belonged to them.</p>
<p>When the mission was first built at San Gabriel the priest
asked an Indian:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you Indians take your children, when they are
sick, to those springs, instead of taking them to a doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Indian answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, the springs at Homuba Canyon can cure any sickness.
That is why we take our children there when they are
sick, and they are healed. Our ancestors used those springs
and became healed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the priest went up to the springs to examine the
water, and he took some of the water and made the Indian
carry it to the chapel, and he blessed the water, and held
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
Mass with it, and used it to cure the sick. And, finally, the
priest moved the mission from San Gabriel to San Bernardino.
Old San Bernardino is now known as Redlands.
The mission was established there. It is about three miles
from the springs. And from there the priest used to send the
Indians to bring the waters to the mission, using it as medicine.
And he cured many sick Indians.</p>
<p>Now there were two Indian villages nearby, and they
fought over the possession of those springs. They went on
the warpath over the Two Sisters and Brother Life Springs.
So the mission went away and settled elsewhere, and the
priest also went away.</p>
<p>Then our white neighbors came, as I said, and drove the
Indians from our sacred springs. That is why the Indians
are dying out in Southern California, because we must live
on worthless lands far away from those springs.</p>
<p>Our white neighbors may think we Indians have no religion,
but that is not so. We do believe in God who is the
Creator of the world, and of the firmament, of Indians as
well as white people.... Therefore we are brothers in
God, as we are created by God.</p>
<p>I often hear white people say they are Americans in America,
and we are Indians. I say we are the native sons of America.
We are good to our country and to our white neighbors,
and do not trouble them. When the missions first came to
this country the Indians were numerous and the country well
inhabited by the Indians. Then the Indians did not know
that the country was going to be filled with intoxicating
liquor. If they had known that, they would never have allowed
the missionaries to establish any missions in this country.
For a great number of Indians died of intoxicating
liquor.</p>
<p>However, the United States Government made a law prohibiting
the sale of intoxicating liquor to the American
Indians. But by that time it was too late. The American Indians
are nearly all gone. But maybe a few will be saved.</p>
<p>It was in 1908 that special officers suppressed the liquor
traffic among the mission Indians in Southern California.
The chief of these special officers came to me and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it that you are always fighting the whites?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because they are all liars, thieves, and whisky peddlers,&rdquo;
I answered.</p>
<p>He looked at me and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I a liar and a whisky peddler?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;You do not look like one. I think you
are on the square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he said to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to work with me on the same job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What job do you mean?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To suppress the liquor traffic among the mission Indians,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>So I was deputized as Special Officer since then, and I became
Chief of Police in the Indian Service for nine Indian
reservations under the United States Government, to protect
the Indians, to make transactions for the Indians, and to
help them become sober, improve their morals, and become
civilized. In 1847 if the United States Government had sent
us a man like Mr. C. T. Coggeshall, who is the superintendent
of the nine Indian reservations, the Indians would never
have lost the Two Sisters and Brother Life Springs. Mr. Coggeshall
is a man with large experience and he has done a
lot of good for the Indians under his jurisdiction.</p>
<p>However, I am glad that Mr. John Console owns the
springs, because he is a friend of the Indians. He helps the
Indians with those springs. The springs cure light sickness,
but for serious sickness we have to use herbs.</p>

<p class="tbcenter"><span class="ss">THE BOTANICAL LORE OF THE CALIFORNIA INDIANS</span></p>
<p class="center"><span class="ss">by
<br />John Bruno Romero
<br />(Ha-Ha-St of Tawee)</span></p>
<p>Rare Indian lore collected and interpreted
by a full-blooded Chu-Mash Indian, who
grew up among members of the Cahuilla
tribe, is revealed in this unique book. Written
by a man who is anxious to share his
ancestral knowledge of the treasures in the
Great Field of Nature, this volume describes
120 medicinal herbs and gives recipes for
their preparation, their uses, their English
and Latin names, and where they may be
found.</p>
<p>The collection presented here was hand-picked
from 500 specimens gathered by
the author on a plant-hunting expedition
on the Pacific Coast and in Arizona. Only
twenty-eight, it is said, are known to modern
medical science.</p>
<p>For more than one hundred years, the
Indians have kept to themselves their profound
knowledge of medicinal herbs and
their application. Meanwhile, if the Indian,
with his intelligent and extraordinary attachment
to nature, had not preserved and
replanted a large number of these herbs,
many of them would now be extinct.</p>
<p>A close collaborator of the historical department
of the Santa Ana Museum in his
native California, the author is known as
a botanist of such high order that some
years back the British Museum sought his
assistance in assembling a remarkable collection
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
of Pacific Coast specimens of medicinal
herbs and Indian artifacts.</p>
<p>Mr. Romero, whose Indian name is Ha-Ha-St
of Tawee, presents his material in
highly entertaining manner, and his remarks,
some of them <i>sotto voce</i>, are extremely
apropos. Adding to the color of the
book is a wonderful legend written by the
author&rsquo;s father, Chief Als Pablo, Chief of
Police of the Indian reservations in the
Southwest at the turn of the century.</p>
<p>The book is dedicated to the memory of
the author&rsquo;s uncle, Chief William Pablo of
Guana-pia-pa, medical herbalist and medicine
man. It is a unique treasury of authentic
Americana, fortunately preserved for
our time.</p>

<p>John Bruno Romero is a descendant of the Chu-Mash, once the largest
and most powerful of Indian tribes, whose domain included all the islands
along the California Coast, and, on the mainland, from the San Fernando
Mission northwest to San Francisco and north-northwest to the High
Sierras.</p>
<p>Mr. Romero was born in Santa Barbara, where he studied Spanish and
Latin at the Franciscan School Mission, and attended the Sherman Institute,
where he was a student of English and scientific subjects. He was later
graduated from the Detroit Veterinarian College.</p>
<p>At one time, the Cahuilla Indians controlled the lands of California
southward to the end of what is now the Mexican peninsula. When the
Chu-Mash tribe, in its later years, had dwindled in numbers, Mr. Romero
joined the Cahuilla tribe &ldquo;to help fight the United States Government for
our land treaty rights.&rdquo; Today this tribe is the second oldest in California
and the strongest in membership.</p>
<p>The author&rsquo;s interests are wide. He is a director of Indian Affairs for
seven Southern California counties, and while his principal hobby is
medicinal botany, he is also a collector of minerals, stamps, books, and
fossils, and dabbles in taxidermy. Fond of children, he has adopted and
reared ten orphans. At one time or another, he has worked as a surveyor,
explorer, geologist, and antho-botanist, and his home is a veritable treasure
trove of interesting archaeological, geological, and botanical specimens
which he has collected in the mountains and deserts of Southern California
and Arizona&mdash;in sections where the white man has seldom traveled.</p>
<p>In 1933 he discovered, in the Trabuco Hills, in Orange County, near
Los Angeles, the skeleton of a mastodon, one of the few uncovered in
Southern California. Paleontologists at the Los Angeles Museum made
varying estimates of the age of the bones, ranging from ten thousand to a
million years.</p>
<p>In 1937, when the author was a junior geologist at the Santa Ana
Museum, he deciphered the hieroglyphics inscribed on some rocks found
on the Indian prayer grounds at the peak of a volcanic vent in La Piomosa
range in Arizona, which have been instrumental in providing historical
information about the life of the early Indians in the Southwest. The inscriptions
revealed the location of food and water in the surrounding
country and primitive conceptions of the supernatural.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
